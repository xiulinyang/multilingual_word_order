The United [MASK] does n't believe the Iranian Government .	States

[MASK] read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .	I

Angry [MASK] chanted anti-American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop. 256,000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday .	crowds
[MASK] reported that " Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today . "	Reuters
[MASK] read , " The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah .	It
The [MASK] demanded talks with local US commanders .	clerics
[MASK] such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country 's wealth and power .	Cities

The Supreme [MASK] announced its ruling today in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .	Court

Important [MASK] such as President Bush 's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti-gay ( update : he 's not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .	news
[MASK] had to go to the BBC for this report .	I
[MASK] 's just disappointing .	It
Most [MASK] , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .	troubling
At that time , UN [MASK] General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .	Secretary
The African [MASK] is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000 , according to analysts .	Union
And international [MASK] have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .	donors
So hear [MASK] are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .	we
[MASK] Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .	Warren
[MASK] 's a move that really worries me ; Buffett 's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .	It
[MASK] 's a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .	It
[MASK] essentially sounds like he 's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .	Which
[MASK] assume his actual reason is that he 's worried that Berkshire Hathaway just ca n't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .	I
[MASK] 'm not sure how the market will react .	I
[MASK] does n't change the company 's intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .	It
On the other hand , [MASK] is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .	this
em ... no ... the Gates [MASK] mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .	foundation

[MASK] over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :	Bill
On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist [MASK] Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .	group
[MASK] has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .	Syria
UN [MASK] - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to " recognize Hezbollah " after easily being duped by " the message on the placards they are using " .	Secretary
This [MASK] of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .	acceptance
Over three years after 9-11 , the United [MASK] , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still can not properly define the word " terrorist " , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts .	Nations
The [MASK] routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .	media
The [MASK] to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .	decision
[MASK] 've been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .	I
[MASK] is a terrorist organization plain and simple .	This
[MASK] is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?	This
[MASK] is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .	This
The Iraqi Islamic [MASK] lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .	Party
[MASK] is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .	It
The [MASK] had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .	IIP
In a communique , the [MASK] said that for Iraqis to take part with " raiding forces " in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins .	AMS
The Sunni [MASK] told Iraqis , " You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah .	AMS
The radical Shiite Sadr [MASK] issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .	movement
The [MASK] said , " We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal . "	statement
[MASK] called a " ploy " the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah .	It
Most [MASK] , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms .	Shiites
[MASK] Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :	President
U.S. Muslim [MASK] criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a " war with Islamic fascists , " saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim tensions .	groups
U.S. [MASK] have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .	officials
[MASK] is why he did n't say we 're at war with Islamic people .	Which
[MASK] 're at war with Islamic fascists .	We
By using the word " Islamic " as an adjective [MASK] was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier .	Bush
And if you have n't heard by now , the [MASK] of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :	roster
[MASK] 've got a Steven , the one word that did n't crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur .	We
Folks , if it 's Islamic , and fascist , [MASK] 's an Islamic fascist .	it
But because we do n't want to sound hateful [MASK] must pretend everyone 's a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it 's ever been .	we
On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the [MASK] allegedly declared , " We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden . "	group
This [MASK] is a new development .	pledge
One [MASK] at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .	witness
If the statement is true , [MASK] is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being " picked up " by al - Qaeda .	it
This [MASK] is obviously a result of Bush 's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .	consolidation
[MASK] is a setback for the war on terror .	It
Al - [MASK] in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred " Afghan Arabs " who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden .	Qaeda
After that point , al - [MASK] was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .	Qaeda
[MASK] is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .	Zarqawi
[MASK] also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .	They
( Most [MASK] are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ) .	Salafis
[MASK] and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .	Monotheism
Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni [MASK] opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .	fundamentalists
The September 11 [MASK] will issue its findings on Thursday .	Panel
[MASK] notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden 's plot .	It
[MASK] of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .	Four
[MASK] came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .	Bush
This [MASK] is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .	statement
Of course [MASK] would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming .	Bush
The question is , " Should [MASK] have known it was coming ? "	he
The [MASK] is , " Yes ! "	answer
[MASK] now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .	We
[MASK] was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 .	Cheney
[MASK] contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .	Wolfowitz
If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then [MASK] will concentrate on the wrong threat .	you
Even after the attacks on September 11 , [MASK] was obsessing about Iraq .	Bush
[MASK] lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .	Wolfowitz
The [MASK] were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ) .	hijackers
[MASK] initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were " no good targets " in Afghanistan .	Rumsfeld
The [MASK] did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .	Pentagon
[MASK] did not have his eye on the ball .	Bush
[MASK] were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale .	They
Imperial [MASK] makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .	Hubris
[MASK] demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .	Bush
[MASK] could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was " on fire " about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists .	Dick
[MASK] had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .	Clinton
[MASK] presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .	I
[MASK] also need Pakistani air space .	You
The [MASK] was all set and could have succeeded .	plan
But in fall of 1999 , [MASK] Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .	Gen.
The Pakistani [MASK] was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .	army
[MASK] told Clinton he could n't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .	Musharraf
Of course , [MASK] could just go in by main force .	you
[MASK] tried , and tried hard .	Clinton
The [MASK] were n't with us on that one .	gods

[MASK] have this report ?	We
Well , [MASK] launched today .	he
Have [MASK] seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today ?	you
[MASK] think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California 's broken system --- a potential spoiler .	I
Well , would n't [MASK] know it .	you
[MASK] 'm not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .	I

Can [MASK] of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year volalatility number for USD / Euro .	one
Ideally , [MASK] would like a fast turnaround .	we
The credit [MASK] are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too .	guys

While Tanya is reviewing credit , can [MASK] please send a " blank form Paragraph 13 " for this master .	you
[MASK] just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft Credit Support Annex ( similar in form to the one previously executed with ENA ) .	I
[MASK] understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime .	I
[MASK] was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process .	I

While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel [MASK] are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels	we
The [MASK] were very over proofed , making them stale and bready .	Donuts
The [MASK] was friendly and fast , but this just does nt make up for the lack - luster product .	service
[MASK] tried 4 different style of donuts , they were all the same when it came to quality .	We
[MASK] live in the neighborhood and this place is one of my favorites for a tasty , quick and inexpensive meal .	I
[MASK] called over the weekend due to clogged kitchen sink .	I
[MASK] was here before the scheduled time .	Rich
[MASK] was very clean , very nice to work with and gave a very reasonable price .	He
Deep tissue [MASK] helps with pain in neck and shoulders	massage
[MASK] provides deep tissue massage which has significantly reduced the pain in my neck and shoulders and added flexibility and movement back to the area .	Seth
[MASK] listens and is excellent in diagnosing , addressing and explaining the specific issues and suggesting exercises to use .	He
[MASK] on adult - learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .	Research
Of interest here , [MASK] suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .	studies
In fact , substantial [MASK] ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] .	periods
In the present study , [MASK] examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed .	we
Additionally , [MASK] test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom - like and immersion - like contexts .	we
[MASK] are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes .	We
The six [MASK] tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .	studies
Across the studies , the [MASK] of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .	periods
The [MASK] lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure .	training
A [MASK] of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .	period
Although attrition may take place within the first few years , some [MASK] suggest that it then appears to level off , with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .	studies
Moreover , one [MASK] found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] .	study
On the administrative level , the [MASK] of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries ( UKB ) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH .	directors
A year later , the National [MASK] of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .	Library
Therefore both [MASK] joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians .	institutes
[MASK] see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries .	We
In essence , [MASK] want to teach our country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects .	we
The [MASK] of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self - directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .	content
[MASK] are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers , but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects , follow the literature and research , follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community .	We
In order to design this curriculum [MASK] follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle ( Williams , 2010 ) :	we
With these in hand , [MASK] will design the curriculum of clinics , based on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) , to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned .	we
Each [MASK] starts with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge needed .	day
By having researchers provide the lecture sessions , [MASK] hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities .	we
With these clinics , [MASK] hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities , making access to support easier for new digital scholars .	we
The [MASK] at DH2017 will present the curriculum , its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics .	poster
[MASK] welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts .	We
[MASK] received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School , and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie , in Dulwich . [ 17 ]	Byron
His [MASK] interfered with his studies , often withdrawing him from school , with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected .	mother
An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer , [MASK] did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord 's in 1805 . [ 19 ]	he
[MASK] fell in love with Mary Chaworth , whom he met while at school , [ 6 ] and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 .	Byron
His [MASK] wrote , " He has no indisposition that I know of but love , desperate love , the worst of all maladies in my opinion . In short , the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth . " [ 6 ]	mother
[MASK] finally returned in January 1804 , [ 6 ] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys , which he recalled with great vividness : " My school friendships were with me passions ( for I was always violent ) . " [ 21 ]	Byron
The most [MASK] of those was with John FitzGibbon , 2nd Earl of Clare — four years Byron 's junior — whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy ( 1821 ) . [ 22 ]	enduring
His nostalgic [MASK] about his Harrow friendships , Childish Recollections ( 1806 ) , express a prescient " consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him . " [ 23 ]	poems
[MASK] to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short - lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow , John Thomas Claridge .	Letters
Sure some stronger [MASK] vibrates here , Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one , who thus for kindred hearts must roam , And seek abroad , the love denied at home .	impulse
The following autumn , [MASK] went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , [ 24 ] where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston .	he
About his " protégé " [MASK] wrote , " He has been my almost constant associate since October , 1805 , when I entered Trinity College . His voice first attracted my attention , his countenance fixed it , and his manners attached me to him for ever . "	he
In his memory [MASK] composed Thyrza , a series of elegies . [ 25 ]	Byron
In later years , [MASK] described the affair as " a violent , though pure love and passion " .	he
This [MASK] , however , needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions ( including public hanging ) against convicted or even suspected offenders . [ 26 ]	statement
The [MASK] , on the other hand , may well have been " pure " out of respect for Edleston 's innocence , in contrast to the ( probably ) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School . [ 27 ]	liaison
[MASK] spent three years at Trinity College , engaging in sexual escapades , boxing , horse riding and gambling . [ 28 ]	Byron
Also while at Cambridge [MASK] formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse , who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club , which endorsed liberal politics , [ 28 ] and Francis Hodgson , a Fellow at King 's College , with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life .	he
[MASK] Abraham Norton ( c. 1818 – January 8 , 1880 ) , known as Emperor Norton , was a citizen of San Francisco , California , who in 1859 proclaimed himself " Norton I , Emperor of the United States " .	Joshua
[MASK] later expanded his pretense by claiming to be " Protector of Mexico " as well .	He
Born in England , [MASK] spent most of his early life in South Africa .	Norton
After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848 , [MASK] sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 .	he
[MASK] initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice .	Norton
After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton 's public [MASK] faded .	prominence
[MASK] reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States .	He
[MASK] had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ;	He
Though some considered him insane or eccentric , [MASK] of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay .	citizens
On January 8 , 1880 , [MASK] collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment .	Norton
Nearly 30,000 [MASK] packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral .	people
By 1859 , [MASK] had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States .	Norton
On September 17 , 1859 , [MASK] took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city , proclaiming himself " Emperor of these United States " :	he
At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States , [MASK] , Joshua Norton , formerly of Algoa Bay , Cape of Good Hope , and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S. F. , Cal. , declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U. S. ;	I
[MASK] would later add " Protector of Mexico " to this title .	Norton
In his self - appointed role of emperor , [MASK] issued numerous decrees on matters of the state .	Norton
After assuming absolute control over the country , [MASK] saw no further need for a legislature , and on October 12 , 1859 , he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress .	he
In it , [MASK] observed :	Norton
... [MASK] and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ;	fraud
that open [MASK] of the laws are constantly occurring , caused by mobs , parties , factions and undue influence of political sects ;	violation
that the [MASK] has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled .	citizen
[MASK] ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to " remedy the evil complained of " .	Norton
In an imperial decree the following month , [MASK] summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress :	Norton
WHEREAS , a [MASK] of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City , in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last , declaring the said Congress abolished ;	body
NOW , THEREFORE , [MASK] do hereby Order and Direct Major - General Scott , the Command - in - Chief of our Armies , immediately upon receipt of this , our Decree , to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress .	we

[MASK] remember the last time , that 's what happened .	You
[MASK] remember ?	You
[MASK] 'm not smart ?	I
[MASK] 're stupid .	You

Every time you take over a country [MASK] get cards .	you
Do n't [MASK] fucking attack me .	you

[MASK] was thirteen .	I
[MASK] was spring , the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer , but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains , of grass and drowned earthworms .	It
And [MASK] has , because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring .	it
[MASK] was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me .	I
My [MASK] were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud .	shoes
My [MASK] and I were going to mass — my mother did not go ; she was Protestant .	father
My [MASK] put his hand on top of my hair , his palm on my head , and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm , so dry and strong .	father
When I was a little girl , [MASK] did that often , and called me Muscles .	he
[MASK] had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time .	He
[MASK] could not help arching my back a little , I wanted to push against his hand like a cat but the instinct that comes with being thirteen , the half - understood caution that makes a girl timid , or wild , the shyness told me to just walk .	I
[MASK] wanted to feel the rough edge of the pocket of his coat against my cheek , but I was too tall .	I
[MASK] wanted to be seven again , and safe .	I
But [MASK] still wanted to push against his hand and put my hand in his pocket and steal the leather palmed glove , that secret animal .	I
Instead [MASK] went into the church , took a Bulletin , dipped my finger in Holy Water and genuflected .	I
The [MASK] of the church smelled like damp wood and furniture polish , not alive at all .	inside
My [MASK] took off his coat and draped it over the edge of the pew and when I came back from communion I stole his glove .	father
The paper [MASK] of the wafer was still in my mouth and I took a deep breath of the leather .	taste
[MASK] smelled like March .	It
[MASK] walked back through the school because it was drizzling , my father tall in his navy suit and my shoes going click on the linoleum .	We
The [MASK] ended in a T and we went left through the gym , walked underneath the bleachers and stood next to the side door , waiting for the rain to stop .	hall
[MASK] was dark under the bleachers .	It
My [MASK] was a young man , thirty - five , younger because he liked to be outside , to play softball on Saturday and to take my mother and me camping on vacation .	father
[MASK] stood rocked back on his heels with his coat thrown over his shoulders and his hands in his pockets .	He
[MASK] thought of bacon and eggs , toast with peach jam out of the jar .	I
[MASK] was so hungry .	I
The [MASK] under the bleachers was secret and dark .	space
The [MASK] from the door made the shadows under the bleachers darker , the long space stretched far away .	light
[MASK] heard the rain and the faint rustle of paper and smelled damp concrete .	I
[MASK] did not go near my father but kept my hand in my pocket , feeling the soft leather glove .	I
[MASK] wondered if anyone ever went back under the bleachers , if there were crickets or mice there .	I
The [MASK] might have been mice .	rustling
[MASK] wished the rain would stop .	I
[MASK] wanted to go home .	I
[MASK] made noises with my heels but they were too loud so I stopped .	I
[MASK] else clicked and I tried to see what it was but could n’t see anything .	Something
[MASK] was n’t as loud as my heels .	It
My [MASK] cleared his throat , looking out the door .	father
[MASK] imagined a man down there in the dark , an escaped convict or a madman .	I
In fifteen minutes [MASK] would be home and my mother would fry eggs .	we
[MASK] heard a noise like paper .	I
My [MASK] heard it , too , but he pretended not to , at least he did n’t turn his head .	father
[MASK] looked at my father but he did n’t turn his head .	I
[MASK] wished he would turn his head .	I
[MASK] had no explanation for the particular combination of sounds .	I
Once in a fever [MASK] heard thousands of birds outside my window and I was terrified that they would fling themselves through the glass and attack me , but it was only the rain on the eaves .	I
My father ’s [MASK] were largely incomprehensible to me , guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations .	actions
[MASK] dwelt in another world , a world of intrigue , bargains , contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island .	He
[MASK] was in many ways a world in himself , whole as a sphere .	He
No doubt his [MASK] were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him , a patriotic islander , to bring me a tutor from Bain : Master Lunre , an Olondrian .	decisions
The [MASK] began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels , the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor .	day
[MASK] stood by the gate , washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes , my mother twisting her hands in her skirt , my father ’s wife with red eyes .	We
[MASK] , grown taller and broad in the shoulders , moaned gently to himself , while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones .	Jom
[MASK] scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company , but before we saw them we heard the children shouting : “ A yellow man ! ”	We
[MASK] glanced at one another in confusion .	We
My [MASK] bit her lower lip ; Jom gave a groan of alarm .	mother
At first [MASK] thought the children meant my father , whose golden skin , the color of the night - monkey ’s pelt , was a rarity in the islands ; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father , and would never have greeted a council - member with such ill - mannered yells .	I
Then [MASK] remembered the only “ yellow man ” I had ever seen , an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood , who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes , attached to his ears with wires , and roamed the hills of Tinimavet , cutting bits off the trees .	I
[MASK] have since learned that that doctor wrote a well - received treatise , On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut , and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel ; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree - cuttings .	I
And there [MASK] were : a chain of riders weaving among the trees .	they
My father ’s plaited [MASK] appeared , his still , imposing figure , and beside him another man , tall and lean , astride an island mule .	umbrella
The hectic [MASK] of the children preceded the company into the village , so that they advanced like a festival , drawing people out of their houses .	screams
As they approached [MASK] saw that my father ’s face was shining with pride , and his bearing had in it a new hauteur , like that of the old island kings .	I
The [MASK] who rode beside him , looking uncomfortable with his long legs , kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule .	man
[MASK] was not yellow , but very pale brown , the color of raw cashews ; he had silver hair , worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap .	He
[MASK] was not the leaf - collecting doctor , but an altogether strange man , with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine - knuckled hands .	He
As he dismounted in front of the house [MASK] heard my mother whispering : “ Protect us , God with the Black - and - White Tail , from that which is not of this earth . ”	I
My [MASK] dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us , grinning .	father
[MASK] thought I caught an odor off him , of fish , sea - sickness and sweat .	I
[MASK] knelt and stared down at the bald ground , murmuring ritual greetings , until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand .	We
Then [MASK] stood , unable to keep from staring at the stranger , who faced us awkwardly , half - smiling , taller than any man there .	we

As of the last advisory , T [MASK] Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track .	C
[MASK] is a Category 3 storm .	That
The [MASK] is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours .	forecast
Yes , [MASK] will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land .	it
[MASK] occurs for two reasons :	This
Yes , the [MASK] is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land .	Cyclone
[MASK] gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land .	Cyclones
In the mean time , much stronger [MASK] over land quickly reduces their strength .	friction
All tropical [MASK] lose strength once they make landfall .	cyclones
However , [MASK] can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding .	they
Phailin 's [MASK] will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland .	winds
Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore [MASK] will immediately begin to lose strength .	it
However , and this is important , [MASK] still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .	it
A previous [MASK] in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead .	cyclone
[MASK] have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm .	I
Hopefully , [MASK] all learn from past mistakes .	we
The [MASK] of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US $ 10 billion .	history
[MASK] do n't have enough information to answer this question , one way or the other .	I
From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian [MASK] appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed .	government
The [MASK] has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past .	government
The [MASK] of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate .	forecasts
Unfortunately , extensive property [MASK] is bound to occur even with the best preparation .	damage
My [MASK] of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space .	knowledge
[MASK] heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history .	I
[MASK] visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [ ... ] sponsored by the Indian government .	I
Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region , the [MASK] is certainly necessary and essential to save lives .	evacuation
[MASK] can not comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone .	I
However , the news [MASK] ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding .	reports
[MASK] is the main killer in these storms .	Water
For this question [MASK] do n't know the ' preparedness ' of the Indian gov't to deal with this .	I
[MASK] interviews Mario J. Lucero and Isabel Ruiz of Heaven Sent Gaming	Wikinews
[MASK] Sent Gaming is basically me and Isabel , I 'm Mario J. Lucero .	Heaven
And , [MASK] 'm Isabel Ruiz .	I
And , together [MASK] formed this thing , it 's sort of like an entertainment team .	we
[MASK] started it basically , because I wanted to - I wanted to work with Isabel on a lot of projects that we had going on together .	We
[MASK] were coming with comics , like , left and right , we were coming up with things like Karis , in high school she came up with that one , I came up with an individual story called Thad 's World Destruction and , she wanted to illustrate it , and so , that 's the way we ended up doing it .	We
Yep , [MASK] like to just make our own original content , and , yep , that 's what we wanted to do .	we
How did [MASK] two meet ?	you
[MASK] met back in high school .	We
But , before hand in middle school , [MASK] kept on hearing about this guy named Mario , and he kept on hearing about me , this girl named Isabel .	I
And , [MASK] , all of our friends and all of our acquaintances would say , " Hey , you 'd get along with him really well . "	everyone
So before hand [MASK] kinda knew about him , but I never met him .	I
And [MASK] of our friends , our common friends , he introduced us during study hall , and we just kind of hit it off from there .	one
[MASK] 's true .	It
Currently , [MASK] 're in talks with people .	we
Right now , yeah , [MASK] 's helping us right now .	he
[MASK] 're talking about doing some individual web series , video series .	We
Josh Kindig , he 's coming on board , he has some ideas for that too , [MASK] wants to take over " aywv " and do more gaming news .	he
Well , back in college , back in Collins College , [MASK] and I , we had met like she said at Sandia View Academy , and we went off to college together in Arizona ;	Isabel
and ... ( how do [MASK] best explain this ? )	I
Basically , [MASK] came up with a few class projects , and I came up with a few class projects ;	she
[MASK] started working with a few of our friends , and colleagues and whatnot .	we
[MASK] included Drew Cass , Devin Thurlow , people like that .	Those
She had several ideas , and she used to draw a lot in the sketchbook , [MASK] used to have this thick sketchbook that she used to carry around with her everywhere , where she 'd draw these different characters and whatnot ;	she
and [MASK] was always really shy to show that off to people , and I wanted to help her show that stuff , and I wanted to bring it out to the world .	she
[MASK] was a writer , and she always liked my writings , so I was like , let 's just get both of our things together , and let 's get this done .	I
[MASK] just want to be able to bring , like she said , bring light into the entertainment and into the media industry , specifically is what we do .	We
[MASK] Sam , 42 , and his wife Manju Sam , 36 , from Sydney , Australia , are undergoing trial for manslaughter by gross negligence for the death of their nine - month - old child , Gloria .	Thomas
[MASK] died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy , a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience .	She
[MASK] in peer - reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery .	Articles
[MASK] developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist .	Gloria
[MASK] Sam , a practising homeopath , instead decided to treat his daughter himself .	Thomas
His daughter 's [MASK] deteriorated , to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin , leading to severe malnutrition and , eventually , her death .	condition
By the end , Gloria 's [MASK] was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy , and in the words of the Crown prosecutor , Mark Tedeschi , QC , " Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying , irritable , scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother 's breast . "	eczema
[MASK] also became unable to move her legs .	Gloria
[MASK] Tedeschi also told the court that , over the last five months of her life , " Gloria 's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other . "	Mr.
However , despite their child 's severe illness , and her lack of improvement , the [MASK] continued to shun conventional medical treatment , instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths .	Sams
[MASK] temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments , but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy , and she consistently worsened .	Gloria
Allegedly , Thomas ' [MASK] pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor , but he replied " I am not able to do that " .	sister
By this time , " her [MASK] was weeping , her body malnourished and her corneas melting " , according to the Sydney Morning Herald .	skin
Speaking in the parents ' defense , [MASK] Molomby , SC , said that , as the parents came from India , where homeopathy is in common use , they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences .	Tom
[MASK] is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that , if given to a healthy person undiluted , would cause symptoms similar to the disease .	Homeopathy
Typical [MASK] take the dilutions , with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution , past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain ; for homeopathic treatments to work , basic well - understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong .	treatments
Australian [MASK] suffering from iodine deficiency	children
Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient , [MASK] say .	researchers
A new [MASK] documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation .	study
The report 's [MASK] say iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one .	authors
The [MASK] of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week , revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient .	results
The [MASK] has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised .	report
[MASK] say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders .	They
The [MASK] say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population .	authors
[MASK] call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . "	They
Most [MASK] in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt .	iodine
[MASK] Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine .	Professor
Iodine [MASK] can lead to serious health problems including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness .	deficiency
[MASK] Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries .	Professor
" I suspect they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis , we 've tried so far and have n't succeeded , so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised , " [MASK] said .	he
The [MASK] says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry , where chlorine - containing sanitisers have replaced iodine - containing sanitisers .	report
[MASK] released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades , but is now declining .	Iodine
Another contributory [MASK] has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods .	factor
The [MASK] states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods .	report
[MASK] Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised .	Professor
[MASK] says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt .	He
" The [MASK] of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs .	effects
So if we go to the pregnant woman , she does n't get enough iodine , she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone , and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain , so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , " [MASK] Eastman said .	Professor
More than two billion [MASK] around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency , and yet the problem is easily fixed .	people
The World Health [MASK] ( WHO ) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt .	Organisation
The most well known [MASK] of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life .	effects
[MASK] say Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage .	WHO
[MASK] Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found .	Professor
" Pregnant [MASK] in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis .	women
So that alarms me , because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country , " [MASK] said .	he
" If Iodine deficiency is serious [MASK] lose 15 IQ points , on average .	you
[MASK] Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year .	Lydia
[MASK] says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right .	She
[MASK] need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine added into the food supply , to help those people with a deficiency .	We
But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people do n't get too much and get overdose , " [MASK] Bauchtman said .	Ms
" One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because [MASK] are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking . "	people
Senior [MASK] Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said " it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient , putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . "	researcher
Madam Speaker , " [MASK] solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump , President of the United States , now pending , I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws . "	I
[MASK] is the oath Senators swore on January 16 .	That
[MASK] is the oath created by Senators when they tried the first impeachment of a President in 1868 .	It
[MASK] is an oath rooted in the Revolution fought by their grandparents to create a republic of laws , not kings .	It
[MASK] is an oath whose power derives from its common sense : that a juror must always be impartial for a trial to be fair .	It
And [MASK] is an oath made necessary by the fact that Senators are not , as we are not , under normal circumstances , impartial in our work .	it
The [MASK] chosen for this oath recognize that when our Constitution calls Senators to try impeachment , it calls them away from their role as partisans .	words
After voting to refuse to hear evidence and call witnesses with pertinent information , nearly all Republican [MASK] have already announced that they will vote against the articles .	Senators
In doing so , [MASK] of them acknowledge that what President Trump did was wrong and inappropriate .	many
[MASK] accept that it was wrong for him to withhold military aid to Ukraine until the President of that country promised to interfere in the American elections .	They
The [MASK] of President Trump 's abuse of power and attempt to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections is clear enough that Republican Senators can not and have not denied the facts , yet they can not bring themselves to confront this President and are choosing party over country .	evidence
The [MASK] from Alaska , in explaining her decision to vote to block witnesses and evidence , tried to deflect responsibility from the consequences of her actions , writing : " I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate . "	Senator
[MASK] agree with that .	I
[MASK] further said : " It is sad for me today to admit that , as an institution , the Congress has failed . "	She
Madam Speaker , the [MASK] has not failed .	Congress
The [MASK] did its job , whether you agree or not .	House
In regular order , by a vote of this House , [MASK] impeached the President of the United States based upon our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .	we
The [MASK] did its job and did so with the solemnity required when undertaking the process of impeachment , which we did not seek but accepted as our responsibility under the Constitution .	House
[MASK] held hearings , called witnesses , and subpoenaed documents .	We
[MASK] is the Senate , Madam Speaker , that will fail if it does not hold this President accountable for using a hold on military aid to compel an ally to interfere in our election for his own personal gain .	It
[MASK] will judge poorly those who choose fear of their party over the courage to do the right thing .	History
Neither the [MASK] nor myself , nor the whip , Jim Clyburn , urged any member in our party to vote any way on impeachment .	Speaker
Our [MASK] voted consistent with their oath of office and the conviction that that vote was required by that oath to protect and defend the Constitution .	members
[MASK] will judge .	Americans
It is because [MASK] know future generations will look back on this chapter in our history and ask :	I
[MASK] stood up for the Constitution and the laws ?	Who
[MASK] stood up for the values our Founders charged us to keep ?	Who
[MASK] refused to shrink from the heavy responsibilities of their oath ?	Who
[MASK] can be proud that the House did its job , followed the law , defended our Constitution .	I
[MASK] did not convict ; that is not our role .	We
[MASK] am also proud of the House managers , as all of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are proud of our managers who made their case .	I
[MASK] made their case with intellect .	They
[MASK] made their case with evidence that had been adduced here in the House .	They
[MASK] made their case and appealed to Senators to hold this President accountable , as our Founders intended .	They
Almost [MASK] has watched a trial either in person or on television .	everybody
A [MASK] is not an opening argument and a closing argument with nothing in between .	trial
Seventy - five [MASK] of our people wanted to have witnesses because that was their understanding of what a trial is , not just argument at the beginning and argument at the end , but evidence for jurors who have pledged to be impartial to consider .	percent
Any [MASK] in this country would agree that opening and closing statements alone are not a trial .	judge
Nevertheless , the House [MASK] proved their case .	managers
The [MASK] is clear .	truth
The American [MASK] know what that truth is and know what this President has done .	people
And [MASK] will remember who on this day abided by the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .	they
To a few of us here today [MASK] is a solemn and most momentous occasion , and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence .	this
The orderly [MASK] of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place , as it has for almost two centuries , and few of us stop to think how unique we really are .	transfer
In the eyes of many in the world , this every 4 - year [MASK] we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle .	ceremony
Mr. President , [MASK] want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition .	I
By your gracious cooperation in the transition process , [MASK] have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other , and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic .	you
The [MASK] of our nation goes forward .	business
[MASK] suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history .	We
[MASK] distorts our economic decisions , penalizes thrift , and crushes the struggling young and the fixed - income elderly alike .	It
[MASK] threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people .	It
Idle [MASK] have cast workers into unemployment , human misery , and personal indignity .	industries
But great as our tax burden is , [MASK] has not kept pace with public spending .	it
For decades [MASK] have piled deficit upon deficit , mortgaging our future and our children 's future for the temporary convenience of the present .	we
[MASK] and I , as individuals , can , by borrowing , live beyond our means , but for only a limited period of time .	You
Why , then , should [MASK] think that collectively , as a nation , we 're not bound by that same limitation ?	we
[MASK] must act today in order to preserve tomorrow .	We
The economic [MASK] we suffer have come upon us over several decades .	ills
[MASK] will not go away in days , weeks , or months , but they will go away .	They
[MASK] will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now , as we 've had in the past , to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom .	They
In this present crisis , [MASK] is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem .	government
Well , if no one among us is capable of governing himself , then [MASK] among us has the capacity to govern someone else ?	who
[MASK] of us together , in and out of government , must bear the burden .	All
The [MASK] we seek must be equitable , with no one group singled out to pay a higher price .	solutions
[MASK] hear much of special interest groups .	We
Well , our [MASK] must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected .	concern
[MASK] knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions , and it crosses political party lines .	It
[MASK] are , in short , " We the people , " this breed called Americans .	They
Well , this administration 's [MASK] will be a healthy , vigorous , growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans , with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination .	objective
[MASK] must share in the productive work of this " new beginning , " and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy .	All
With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength , [MASK] can have a strong and prosperous America , at peace with itself and the world .	we
A [MASK] is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people .	democracy
In a representative democracy , however , the [MASK] do not govern directly .	citizens
Instead , [MASK] elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people .	they
Thus , U.S. [MASK] vote for members of Congress , the president and vice president , members of state legislatures , governors , mayors , and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf .	citizens
Most representative [MASK] favor majority rule :	governments
the [MASK] of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority .	opinions
In a direct democracy , unlike representative democracy , [MASK] participate directly in making government decisions .	people
Here [MASK] debated and voted for or against all proposed laws .	they
Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy — the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government — some [MASK] of direct democracy do exist in the United States .	elements
While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress , [MASK] may still directly vote on certain issues .	people
Such [MASK] provide additional opportunities for civic engagement .	occasions
[MASK] of Boxborough , Massachusetts , gather in a local hotel to discuss issues affecting their town .	Residents
New England town [MASK] provide an opportunity for people to experience direct democracy .	meetings
This [MASK] has lasted for hundreds of years .	tradition
Most [MASK] now have some form of representative government ( Figure 1.6 ) . 5	countries
In a monarchy , one [MASK] , usually a hereditary ruler , holds political power .	ruler
Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law , and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , [MASK] is not always the case .	this
Many southwest Asian [MASK] , such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates , have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted .	kingdoms
As discussed earlier , another nondemocratic [MASK] of government is oligarchy , in which a handful of elite members of society , often those who belong to a particular political party , hold all political power .	form
Some nondemocratic [MASK] are totalitarian in nature .	societies
Under totalitarianism , the [MASK] is more important than the citizens , and it controls all aspects of citizens ’ lives .	government
These [MASK] of government are fairly rare .	forms
North [MASK] is an example of a totalitarian government .	Korea
The [MASK] of the world shows the different forms of government that currently exist .	map
[MASK] that are colored blue have some form of representative democracy , although the people may not have as much political power as they do in the United States .	Countries
[MASK] that are colored red , like China , Vietnam , and Cuba , have an oligarchic form of government .	Countries
[MASK] that are colored yellow are monarchies where the people play little part in governing .	Countries
The CIA [MASK] provides information about the types of government across the world .	website
When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service , [MASK] and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output .	workers
In his observations of pin factories , [MASK] noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day , but that a small business of 10 workers ( some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin - making ) , could make 48,000 pins in a day .	Smith
How can a [MASK] of workers , each specializing in certain tasks , produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ?	group
[MASK] offered three reasons .	Smith
First , [MASK] in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .	specialization
( In later chapters , [MASK] will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )	we
[MASK] have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others .	People
Only [MASK] with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance .	those
For some goods , [MASK] affects specialization .	geography
Whatever the reason , if people specialize in the production of what they do best , [MASK] will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things , some of which they are good at and some of which they are not .	they
Second , [MASK] who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality .	workers
This [MASK] holds true for many workers , including assembly line laborers who build cars , stylists who cut hair , and doctors who perform heart surgery .	pattern
In fact , specialized [MASK] often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better .	workers
A similar [MASK] often operates within businesses .	pattern
In many cases , a [MASK] that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .	business
Third , [MASK] allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .	specialization
For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each [MASK] will be quite expensive to make on average .	car
However , if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , then [MASK] can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks , and the average cost of production per car will be lower .	it
The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents , learn to do their specialized jobs better , and work in larger organizations is that [MASK] as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services .	society
The [MASK] and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity .	division
My [MASK] is Katie and today I 'm going to be talking about my two and a half week long vacation to Portland , Oregon .	name
So [MASK] am from Washington D.C. , and I have a bunch of family in Portland , Oregon , so it was n't my first time going there .	I
Um but [MASK] was definitely my first time , like as an adult .	it
So [MASK] was really exciting and fun .	that
[MASK] thought that I would make sort of like more of an informative video because I could just like post a vlog , but um the footage was like so random , and all over the place .	I
[MASK] got some really cool footage but um , not like cute like Instagram girl footage , because I did dress like a 12 year old boy the whole time .	I
So the first [MASK] that I recommend you do in Portland is not actually in Portland at all .	thing
So [MASK] might be like this is a terrible list .	you
The number one thing that we did on our trip was [MASK] actually stayed a night in Eugene , Oregon , and we got up at like the crack of dawn and drove to Crater Lake .	we
[MASK] was incredible .	This
The footage that I 'm gon na put in here honestly [MASK] looks a little bit fake .	it
This [MASK] was incredible .	place
[MASK] did n't do a whole lot of hiking here because there was not a whole lot of cloud coverage that day , and it was so hot .	We
So what we did was [MASK] drove around the entire perimeter of the lake and you get all these incredible views of the mountains and the lake , and seeing it from all the different angles was so worth it .	we
So maybe [MASK] is not something that you want to do if you 're just going to Portland for a couple of days but it 's definitely something to consider if you 're going out to Oregon for a little bit longer period of time .	this
[MASK] two is shopping .	Number
[MASK] are in no particular order by the way .	These
[MASK] 're just sort of like what I thought of as I was making this video .	They
And then [MASK] of the biggest things that you should check out while you 're there is Powell 's which is a bookstore .	one
And [MASK] want to say it 's like the the biggest like Indie Indie bookstore in America .	I
[MASK] guess that 's what it 's called .	I
I 'm gon na – oh , [MASK] 's the world 's largest independent bookstore .	it
So this [MASK] was so cool we could have spent hours in here .	place
The best thing that I thought about this bookstore was that [MASK] mixed in new copies of books with used copies .	they
So if you 're looking for a book and you 're wondering like – oh I wonder if I could get this used , like [MASK] 's usually right next to it , which I thought was just like so awesome .	it
[MASK] was very exciting for me because I love a used book .	That
So [MASK] am not a huge like nature person .	I
Um [MASK] do n't enjoy bugs .	I
But um [MASK] will go on a good hike from now and again so just like you know where I 'm coming from .	I
My [MASK] Andrea is a biology major so we did stop to look at many slugs that were on the ground and I did beeline it away from the slugs .	friend
But if you like slugs , you 're in – [MASK] 're in luck .	you
So the first couple days we were in Portland , [MASK] went hiking in Forest Park which you can get to by public transit in the city .	we
[MASK] 's really quick and some of the trails even pop you back out into like the city , so it 's – it 's really super accessible .	It
So [MASK] did the Wildwood Trail and we also did a tour of Pittock Mansion .	we
Um if you do n't want to do a tour of Pittock Mansion , [MASK] 'd still recommend like taking the trail up there because it has a really cool like overlook of the city that you can go see .	I
Um [MASK] loved doing that .	I
So [MASK] four are the Japanese gardens and the rose gardens in Forest Park .	number
[MASK] actually do n't know if they 're like technically in Forest Park but they 're right in the same area .	I
So the rose [MASK] is free and open to the public and it is just huge .	garden
[MASK] 's a lot of roses as you can imagine .	It
[MASK] get to walk through all these gardens and different types of roses from different parts of the world and yeah it was just really cool .	You
If it 's a clear day [MASK] can actually see Mount Hood from the Japanese gardens which was really wild , and the garden was just so pretty and quiet and serene .	you
[MASK] did wear my bird shirt – It 's a pretty good bird shirt , I got a compliment on it – which I did n't say this earlier , but I bought this at the Audubon Society which I learned what that was .	I
[MASK] did n't know what that was but it 's um a society for um like bird watching and bird care and um they had a shirt that said bird nerd on it so I bought it because I thought it was funny .	I
[MASK] 's up YouTube ?	What
So [MASK] are going to do a week of me vlogging .	we
[MASK] 's kind of an interesting week .	It
[MASK] bounced around here and there , so I have to kind of show you guys around and show you what it 's all about , and today I 'm on general nuclear medicine , so let 's start the day .	I
So like I said , [MASK] 'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week .	I
So so far this morning [MASK] 've just read a few studies ( it 's a little slow in the morning ) of general nuclear medicine because a lot of stuff takes time for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ we are targeting , so we have to wait a little bit in the morning .	I
So [MASK] 've done three lymphoscintigraphies .	I
For lymphoscintigraphies [MASK] basically inject technetium in skin surrounding a melanoma and after we inject we wait about 15 - 20 minutes , maybe up to an hour , and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node which we would call the sentinel lymph node .	we
What we do is [MASK] mark it under our cameras and then the patient will go up to the OR , have the melanoma , a wide excision of the melanoma , and then they will try to find the lymph node that we marked and take that one out as well to make sure there 's no metastasis .	we
So [MASK] 've done three of those this morning .	I
[MASK] will read a few more scans coming up here shortly and just trying to tie up some loose ends before I go to conference .	I
[MASK] 'll check back in afterwards .	I
Ah , the [MASK] feels so good on the face .	sun
[MASK] 'm officially done .	I
[MASK] is about 4:00 p.m.	It
[MASK] get to head home early today because we finished off the scans , and I 'm gon na go home and work out because I was too lazy to do it this morning because for some reason I was tired from having a weekend off , which makes no sense .	We
But [MASK] 'm gon na go work out , cook something for dinner and do this all over again tomorrow .	I
[MASK] 're on a different rotation tomorrow so stay tuned to find out which one .	We
Alright [MASK] is day two .	it
[MASK] is Tuesday and today I got pulled to ultrasound .	It
Yes , [MASK] do n't know why I got pulled on today , but I did , so probably just sit in there , read some ultrasounds and get out early .	I
[MASK] need to film another YouTube video .	I
Alright so [MASK] 've been here just crushing ultrasounds , and today I 've been feeling a little under the weather so I 've been , like , yeah , I 've been like crushing these all day today and then I 'll show you what else I 've been .	I
[MASK] picked these up when I was in Amsterdam for ...	I
[MASK] got sick when I was on Croatia for vacation .	I
[MASK] have no idea what it says , but I think they 're cough drops , so if anybody knows what this says let me know .	I
But [MASK] 'm pretty sure it 's just cough drops with some vitamin C in it .	I
Oh and PS , [MASK] usually try to avoid taking medicines that I ca n't read the name of but I had someone help me at the pharmacy in the airport .	I
[MASK] spoke a little bit of English and I think those are actually cough drops , so , that 's the only reason I 'm still eating them today .	She
[MASK] can tell by my voice it 's a little on the sore side today so hopefully I get better because , I have n't told you guys yet , but I 'm going somewhere this weekend and it 's gon na be fun .	You
Now [MASK] 's time to get back to work .	it
So [MASK] 'm officially going home right now .	I
Yeah , normally [MASK] would go home and work out , especially since it 's , like , a beautiful day I would probably go running .	I
But since I feel kind of crappy today [MASK] 'm just going to go home , hang out , rest ( ambulance was a little loud sorry ) .	I
So [MASK] 'm probably just gon na go home and rest and I have to get my hair cut today for my big trip coming up .	I
But [MASK] still do n't know where I 'm going .	you
But yeah [MASK] 's pretty much it , hope you guys do n't mind this kind of like random vlog that I 'm doing , but I just wanted to show you guys kind of loosely like how a week is and the life of a radiology resident .	that
So hopefully you [MASK] find it somewhat interesting , and if you do I 'll keep doing it .	guys
[MASK] ( Greek : Αθήνα , Athína ) , is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants .	Athens
[MASK] is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece , and therefore of Western civilization .	It
The [MASK] says that the King of Athens , Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom ( c. 1230 BC ) .	legend
This [MASK] of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland , but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility .	process
By the 7th century BC , social [MASK] had become widespread , and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code ( hence " draconian " ) .	unrest
When this failed , [MASK] appointed Solon , with a mandate to create a new constitution ( 594 ) .	they
[MASK] was the great beginning of a new social revolution , which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes ( 508 BC ) .	This
During the Middle Ages , [MASK] experienced a decline , but re-emerged under Byzantian rule .	Athens
[MASK] was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades , actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period .	Athens
However , this fruitful [MASK] was short - lived , as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire , only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece .	period
[MASK] hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games .	Athens
While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban [MASK] of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike .	area
Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic [MASK] underwent serious renovation .	center
The ancient Olympic [MASK] took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD .	Games
[MASK] is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia , but quite interesting .	It
[MASK] was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State .	Athens
Although it had a prestigious past , the city 's political , economic , and cultural [MASK] had declined over the centuries , leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times .	importance
The [MASK] regained its importance in Greek civilization , and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city , with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation 's past .	city
The 20th [MASK] however , marked the rapid development of Athens .	century
The [MASK] suffered minor damage during WWII , and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed , as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized .	city
The [MASK] also expanded outward through rash development , particularly towards the west , as its population grew by absorbing job - seekers from the provinces .	city
With the onset of the automobile , public [MASK] reduced the city 's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s .	officials
By the late 1980s and early 1990s , the city 's [MASK] led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and , coupled with the country 's new found remarkable prosperity , large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades .	reality
[MASK] today is ever evolving , forging a brand new identity for the 21st century .	Athens
[MASK] and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens .	Spring
[MASK] can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves , but this rarely happens .	Summer
[MASK] is definitely low season , with the occasional rainy or snowy day , but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists .	Winter
Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads , on most sunny days the [MASK] are azure blue .	skies
The government 's [MASK] on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin .	ban
[MASK] is in the province of Palawan , Philippines on Busuanga Island .	Coron
[MASK] is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations .	It
[MASK] is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga , and the name of a different , smaller island just offshore .	Coron
The [MASK] is famous for its World War II wreck diving , and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world .	area
The [MASK] is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef .	result
Barracuda and Kayangan [MASK] are both stunning locations , and good for snorkeling , and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night .	lakes
The first [MASK] of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago .	inhabitants
[MASK] were a nomadic , seafaring people , living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture .	They
Although they are now sedentary ( with the young using cell phones , etc. ) , [MASK] maintain many of their old customs , traditions and beliefs .	they
Today , the [MASK] remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron .	Tagbanuas
From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II , the [MASK] experienced the mining boom .	municipality
[MASK] shifted from farming to mining .	Labor
In July 1942 the [MASK] occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines .	Japanese
To this day , about [MASK] or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world .	10
The [MASK] increased , as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners .	population
In the past , [MASK] was virtually unknown outside of Palawan .	Coron
[MASK] remains a small , quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing , slowly but steadily ,	It
[MASK] has taken an important position in the tourism industry .	Coron
From one - liners to classic three - liners to the one - minute gag you tell your friends , a good [MASK] pleases everyone .	joke
Joke - [MASK] is one of the best ways to ease tension , make a new friend , or light up a room .	telling
That is , of course , if [MASK] can get a laugh .	you
All [MASK] of the joke you tell , from the content to the length , need to be suited to your audience .	aspects
[MASK] ’s an individual , so there are no hard and fast rules .	Everyone
elderly [MASK] wo n’t like crude jokes ;	people
[MASK] of a specific ethnic or racial group wo n’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group ;	people
[MASK] can find fodder lots of places — from your life , joke files online , by repurposing jokes you ’ve heard in the past , and so on .	You
[MASK] may want to start your own joke file .	You
[MASK] can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer . [ 1 ]	You
The latter [MASK] may allow for easier revision .	option
Every [MASK] has a “ target , ” which is what the joke is about .	joke
For example , [MASK] are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa ;	husbands
[MASK] will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous .	students
The [MASK] of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it , but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge . [ 3 ]	opening
[MASK] ’s a fundamental part of the joke ;	It
if you do n’t lay a good foundation here , then the [MASK] wo n’t make sense to the audience or they wo n’t find it humorous .	punchline
Your [MASK] needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny —	setup
The [MASK] can be slight or considerable —	exaggeration
[MASK] just depends on the individual joke .	it
The [MASK] of the joke is obviously crucial .	ending
[MASK] is where the payoff comes in , what makes the joke succeed or fail .	This
If you want to make the audience laugh , your [MASK] needs to be surprising .	punchline
Some [MASK] also have what is called a tag or topper , which is an additional punchline .	jokes
The [MASK] builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way .	tag
[MASK] of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told .	Lots
For your joke to be funny , [MASK] has to surprise the audience in some way , which means it has to seem original or new .	it
[MASK] will make a familiar joke unrecognizable .	This
[MASK] may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s) . [ 6 ]	It
[MASK] do n’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact , you " should n’t " memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it , so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked , which is very possible once you ’re in front of an audience .	You
Memorized [MASK] sound wooden , like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer .	jokes
Good [MASK] have a lot of details and personality , so do n’t be afraid to embellish . [ 7 ]	jokes
If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s , your [MASK] is n’t ready and you need to practice more . [ 8 ]	joke
[MASK] can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you ’re ready for a “ real ” audience .	You
Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute , those [MASK] are going to need washing sooner or later .	overalls
Your [MASK] are also murder on the straps , which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls .	appliances
This [MASK] will show you how to save time and prevent wear , extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed .	article
If you did n’t know already , the [MASK] is the top front part with the breast pockets .	bib
[MASK] will help keep them from twisting up during the wash .	This
This [MASK] will reapportion years of your life in the long run .	step
If your washing machine is worth its salt , [MASK] will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it .	it
[MASK] have more pockets than pants .	Overalls
The [MASK] has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket .	bib
[MASK] put rocks , candy , and bugs in these .	Kids
[MASK] put cell phones and small tools in them .	Men
[MASK] defy the laws of purse - space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit .	Women
[MASK] ’ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer .	You
Depending on the adjusters , [MASK] may be able to leave them a little loose too .	you
The [MASK] wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) .	straps
[MASK] is the same idea as rotating tires .	This
[MASK] know about rotating your tires , do n't you ?	You
[MASK] will cut down on some of the racket , but you 're still going to hear them .	This
The paper - type twist [MASK] will deteriorate a little , but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout .	ties
Plastic - type twist [MASK] will hold up in the wash , but may or may not melt in your dryer .	ties
[MASK] of the content in this topic may not be applicable to some languages .	Some
[MASK] can create SQL queries in one of two ANSI SQL query modes :	You
[MASK] describes the traditional Jet SQL syntax .	ANSI-89
This [MASK] conforms closely to the ANSI-89 Level 1 specification , but is not ANSI-89 Level 1 compliant .	mode
[MASK] provides new reserved words , syntax rules , and wildcard characters that enhance your ability to create queries , filters , and SQL statements .	ANSI-92
This [MASK] conforms closely to the ANSI-92 Level 1 specification , but is not ANSI-92 Level 1 compliant .	mode
This query [MASK] has more of the ANSI syntax , and the wildcard characters conform to the SQL specification .	mode
In Microsoft Access 2000 using ADOX , [MASK] could programmatically create queries that used ANSI-92 SQL syntax .	you
However , any [MASK] you created were not visible in the Database window because there was no option to set this mode in the user interface .	queries
Now in Access 2002 , [MASK] can set the ANSI SQL query mode through the user interface for the current database and as the default setting for new databases .	you
[MASK] may want to use ANSI-92 SQL for the following reasons :	You
[MASK] anticipate upsizing your application in the future to an Access project and want to create queries that will run with minimal changes in a Microsoft SQL Server database .	You
[MASK] want to take advantage of the new features not found in ANSI-89 SQL , such as :	You
Why [MASK] should avoid mixing queries created under different ANSI SQL query modes	you
[MASK] is the default setting for a new Access database in 2002 and 2000 file format .	ANSI-89
[MASK] can not set the SQL query mode new database default to ANSI-92 in 2000 file format because the option is disabled ;	You
[MASK] is the only query mode setting available for a database in Access 2000 file format .	ANSI-89
A connection [MASK] stores information about a connection to a data source ( such as an OLE DB data source ) and the data associated with the connection .	file
In Microsoft Access , [MASK] can use a connection file to bind one or more data access pages to a data source .	you
When you open a page , [MASK] reads the connection file that is linked to the page , and based on the contents of the connection file , connects the page to the appropriate data source .	Access
A connection [MASK] uses one of the following file formats :	file
[MASK] can view or edit the contents of the file in any text editor .	You
[MASK] that connect to a common data source can share a single connection file .	Pages
If you move or copy the data source , instead of updating the ConnectionString property of each dependent page , [MASK] only need to edit the connection information in the connection file to make the pages point to the right location or database .	you
When creating a data access page , [MASK] can choose whether you want to link the page to a connection file or simply use a connection file without creating a link .	you
[MASK] can also choose whether you want to use an existing connection file or create a new one .	You
Each time [MASK] open the page , Access will read the connection file , extract the connection information , and set the ConnectionString property of the page .	you
When creating a page , [MASK] can use the contents of a connection file to set the ConnectionString property of the page , but choose not to create a link between the page and the connection file .	you
When you create a link , [MASK] will automatically set the ConnectionString property based on the contents of the connection file .	Access
[MASK] will create a backup copy of the page ( pagefilename.bak.htm ) at the same location as the original data access page file .	Access
If the data access page includes any Microsoft Office Web Components ( a PivotTable list , chart , or spreadsheet ) , only [MASK] with a valid Microsoft Office 2002 license will be able to use those components .	users
[MASK] Access provides several techniques to help you analyze data .	Microsoft
[MASK] can use a crosstab query to calculate and restructure data for easier analysis .	You
Crosstab [MASK] calculate a sum , average , count , or other type of total for data that is grouped by two types of information – one down the left side of the datasheet and another across the top .	queries
A PivotTable [MASK] is an interactive table that you can use to analyze data dynamically from within a Web browser .	list
At run time , [MASK] can change the layout of the PivotTable list .	users
[MASK] can move the fields that are displayed in the row , column , and data area of the PivotTable list , or add or remove fields from the list .	They
[MASK] can also filter , sort , and group data .	Users
The following [MASK] shows a PivotTable list on the Orders data access page .	illustration
[MASK] 2002 provides a PivotTable view for datasheets and forms .	Access
In this view , [MASK] can build an interactive report using the fields underlying the datasheet or form .	you
The [MASK] uses a Microsoft Office PivotTable Component , so you can do all the things that you can do on a PivotTable list .	view
[MASK] can add fields to the view , move or remove fields , and filter , sort , and group data .	You
The following [MASK] shows the Employees table in PivotTable view .	illustration
[MASK] can control how the data is presented in a PivotTable view by customizing the layout .	You
A different [MASK] lets you calculate and compare summarized values for different elements in your data , or display summaries for a subset of the data .	layout
[MASK] change the layout by moving the fields to predefined drop areas within the PivotTable view workspace .	You
After you move fields to the drop areas so that the drop area captions are covered up , [MASK] can still drag additional fields to the areas .	you
Filter [MASK] allow you to confine the view to a particular part of the available data .	fields
For example , when you move a Product field to the filter area , [MASK] can display data for one product at a time .	you
The other [MASK] are outer fields .	fields
[MASK] can switch the inner and outer fields .	You
The [MASK] of a PivotTable view does not have to include all of the fields that are available from the underlying record source .	layout
[MASK] can also remove fields that you no longer want to see from the PivotTable view layout .	You
[MASK] change the layout of a chart by moving the fields to predefined drop areas within the chart workspace .	You
[MASK] Explorer has a default , built-in style sheet that displays the XML source as a (collapsible|expandable) tree .	Internet
[MASK] can use style sheets to insure that the XML-based Web pages on your intranet or Website are consistent and present a uniform appearance without having to add HTML to each page .	You
[MASK] for Transformation ( XSLT ) is a specification that is currently under development by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , and supported by Access .	XSL
[MASK] is an XML-based language that allows one XML document to be mapped , or transformed , into another XML document .	XSLT
[MASK] provides a way of transforming an XML document 's presentation information from a source format to a target format and back again .	This
Typically , a [MASK] creates an XSL transformation file that , when applied to an XML document during export , interprets or transforms the XML data into a presentation format that can be recognized by another application , such as Service Advertising Protocol ( SAP ) or a custom purchase order format .	developer
[MASK] has many of the constructs ( structures and commands ) found in other programming languages which allow the developer to use variables , loops and iterations , and conditional statements .	XSLT
[MASK] gives the developer considerable control over the output of the XML data .	This
In Access , [MASK] can export the data , the schema ( data structure ) , or both , to XML files .	you
[MASK] can also transform the data to another presentation format using an Extensible Style Language ( XSL ) file during the export process .	You
[MASK] can export tables , queries , and the data behind forms or reports from a Microsoft Access database ( .mdb ) as well as tables , views , stored produces , functions , and the data behind forms and reports from a Microsoft Access project ( .adp ) .	You
[MASK] can export a database object as an XML document in several ways :	You
[MASK] can export just the data from a table , query , datasheet , form , or report into an XML file .	You
[MASK] can export just the schema ( data structure ) of a table , query , datasheet , form , or report to an XML schema file .	You
An XML schema [MASK] is a formal specification of the rules for an XML document , providing a series of element names , as well as which elements are allowed in the document and in what combinations .	file
When you export a table to an XML document , [MASK] can also export related tables .	you
For example , if you export a table of Customers Orders , [MASK] can also choose to export a related Orders Details table and Customers table into the same file .	you
If selected , [MASK] can also save the structure of a table , query , datasheet , form , or report into a file that describes the presentation and connection information .	you
For tables , queries-views , and datasheets , the presentation [MASK] is a spreadsheet-like template .	file
In addition , when you choose to save the data as XML , [MASK] can specify that the data be transformed to a custom display format by using an existing .xsl file .	you
[MASK] is a " language " developed by Microsoft and specific to Access which can be used to describe Access database objects in XML .	ReportML
When you export data from Access to an XML file , [MASK] choose to save the structure of a form or report into a ReportML format .	you
Any XML [MASK] produced by Access is well-formed , which means that it conforms to the basic rules of XML .	document
[MASK] is :	That
Each XML [MASK] must have a unique root element ( an element encompassing the entire document ) .	document
All start and end [MASK] match .	tags
XML [MASK] are case-sensitive .	tags
Again , XML [MASK] are case-sensitive .	tags
Access [MASK] will not write out any empty tags .	ReportML
[MASK] do not overlap .	Elements
In other words , start and end [MASK] must be properly nested within other elements .	tag
Certain reserve [MASK] are part of the XML syntax and will not be interpreted as themselves if used in the data portion of an element .	characters
[MASK] need to substitute a special character sequence ( called an " entity " by XML ) as follows :	You
The [MASK] is optional but is recommended in any XML document .	declaration
The [MASK] has a special purpose in an XML document and can be misinterpreted if used directly in the text .	apostrophe
[MASK] means that in addition to being well-formed , the documents conform to a defined schema .	This
To view and modify the contents of a PivotTable view by using Excel , [MASK] can export the PivotTable view to Excel .	you
Excel PivotTable [MASK] can not display detail fields .	reports
When you export to Excel , detail [MASK] will be available on the PivotTable toolbar in Excel , but the fields wo n't be displayed in the report .	fields
After [MASK] export	you
[MASK] might notice some differences in your PivotTable view after you export it to Excel .	You
[MASK] is because PivotTable views use the Microsoft Office PivotTable Component , and Excel PivotTable reports either do not support certain PivotTable list features , or they implement some features differently .	This
[MASK] can also copy data displayed in a PivotTable view to other programs , such as Microsoft FrontPage .	You
[MASK] can use the filter feature to find specific data values or all data that matches a value .	You
[MASK] can filter fields in the row , column , and detail areas .	You
When you filter a field , [MASK] select one or more items of data in the field that you want to view , and hide the other items .	you
3 When you filter a field , the drop-down arrow Field [MASK] for the filtered field changes to blue instead of black , and the AutoFilter button on the toolbar is selected .	arrow
[MASK] can apply a filter to a series or category field to show the top or bottom n items based on a total .	You
For example , [MASK] can filter for the three cities that generated the most sales or the five products that are least profitable .	you
Instead of n items , [MASK] can also choose to filter for a certain percentage of items .	you
For example , [MASK] can filter for the top 25 % or bottom 25 % of salespeople based on the number of orders handled .	you
If there are 40 salespeople , after the filter is applied , [MASK] will see data for 10 people .	you
When you filter a field , [MASK] can display the data for a single item , or you can select some items to display and other items to hide .	you
[MASK] can filter on more than one field at a time to further narrow the focus .	You
[MASK] can filter a field to display only data that matches the value in a selected cell .	You
[MASK] can also filter data by using filter fields .	You
When you select one or more items in the filter field , the [MASK] that 's displayed and calculated in the entire PivotTable view changes to reflect those items .	data
[MASK] can add new filter fields or move existing fields to the filter area .	You
If you move the line upward , the [MASK] between the moving line and the nearest parallel line below remains constant , and the perpendicular line above the moving line contracts .	distance
If you move the line downward , the [MASK] between the moving line and the nearest parallel line below remains constant , and the perpendicular line above the moving line lengthens .	distance
If you are moving the line away from the center of the grid , the nearest parallel [MASK] does n't move , and the distance between the line you are moving and the nearest parallel line grows larger .	line
If you are moving the line towards the center of the grid , the nearest parallel [MASK] does n't move , and the distance between the line you are moving and the nearest parallel line grows smaller .	line
When you copy an interior vertical line , the new [MASK] is halfway between the line you copied and the line to the right of the line you copied .	line
When you copy an interior horizontal line , the new [MASK] is halfway between the line you copied and the line below the line you copied .	line
After you paste the line , [MASK] do not need to recreate the group – the new line is automatically part of the group .	you
The aggregate [MASK] wo n't include records containing blank ( Null ) values in their calculations .	functions
For example , the Count [MASK] returns a count of all the records without Null values .	function
If some records in one of the fields you used in the expression might have a Null value , [MASK] can convert the Null value to zero using the Nz function as shown in the following example :	you
When you design a Web page using Microsoft Office Web Components , any [MASK] with a Microsoft Office 2002 license can interact with the components in the browser to the level of interactivity you provide .	user
That is , a [MASK] with an appropriate license can make changes to data in a spreadsheet , change formatting , drag fields in a chart or PivotTable List , and so on , as long as you did n't protect these options at design time .	user
[MASK] with an Office 2002 license can also create , design , and modify components in a design environment such as Microsoft FrontPage or Microsoft Access .	Users
[MASK] who do not have Office 2002 licenses can view the components and the data in them , and can print the view of the components , but they can not interact with the components or manipulate them in a design environment .	Users
[MASK] means that if you distribute a Web page that uses components , users who have Office 2002 licenses will have access to all functionality provided , but users without a license can only view the data and information you 've provided .	This
The Web page [MASK] must also provide an installation point for the components and a pointer to that location on the component installation page .	designer
Once the Office Web Components are installed , [MASK] who have access to an Office 2002 license will be able to interact with and make changes to the components .	users
[MASK] without licenses will be able to view and print the components and the data in them , but they can not interact with or make changes to them .	Users
[MASK] have full functionality and interactivity with components , including run-time and design-time capabilities .	Users
[MASK] can interact with the component in design mode in that application only ( not in the browser or in other applications ) .	Users
However , the Web page [MASK] must provide a location from which components can be downloaded , and must reference the site license in a license package file ( .lpk ) that is associated with one or more Web pages .	designer
[MASK] use the License Package Authoring Tool to create an appropriate license file for pages .	You
[MASK] can view and print the components in view-only mode , but they can not interact with the components or use the design capabilities .	Users
The two ANSI SQL query [MASK] , ANSI-89 and ANSI-92 , are not compatible .	modes
When you create a Microsoft Access database , [MASK] need to decide which query mode you are going to use , because mixing queries created in both query modes could produce runtime errors or unexpected results .	you
The [MASK] of data types , reserved words , and wildcard characters are different in each query mode .	range
A [MASK] that uses wildcard characters in a criteria expression can produce different results under each query mode .	query
For example , if [MASK] run :	you
[MASK] returns all customers from a (country|region) named " U % " , not all (countries|regions) beginning with the letter " U " , because the percent sign ( % ) is not a wildcard character in ANSI-89 SQL .	It
If a query uses an alias that is the same as a base column name and you create a calculated field using the ambiguous name , the [MASK] will produce different results under each query mode .	query
[MASK] could break your application and require rewriting your application .	This
In Access 2000 , [MASK] can only programmatically change the ANSI SQL query mode and any queries created under ANSI-92 mode were hidden in the Database window .	you
In Access 2002 , [MASK] or a user can change ANSI SQL query mode through the user interface and ANSI-92 queries are no longer hidden in the Database window , so you should prevent accidental or intentional changes to the ANSI SQL query mode of your application by protecting your code and preventing the changing of the query mode through the application 's user interface .	you
About how [MASK] searches for reference libraries	Access
The Visual Basic [MASK] of a Microsoft Access file contains references to object libraries , and it can also contain references to other files , including other Access files .	project
When you open an Access file , if Access does n't find a referenced file in the specified location , [MASK] searches for the reference as follows .	it
First , [MASK] searches for a RefLibPaths key in the following location in the Microsoft Windows Registry :	Access
If the key exists , [MASK] checks for the existence of a value name that matches the name of the referenced file .	Access
If it finds a matching value name , [MASK] loads the reference from the path specified in the corresponding value data .	Access
If Access does n't find a RefLibPaths key , [MASK] searches for the referenced file in the locations listed below in the following order :	it
If Access still ca n't find the reference after performing this search , [MASK] must fix the reference manually .	you
[MASK] can also save tables , views , stored procedures , functions , and forms in a Microsoft Access project as a data access page .	You
For example , if you have a sales report that you want to make available over the Web , instead of creating a data access page and customizing it to look like the sales report , [MASK] can save the report as a data access page .	you
If you want to make changes to the design of the resulting page , [MASK] can open the page in Design view and make any changes you want .	you
The default [MASK] – the view in which the object is open when you carry out the Save As command – determines the design of the data access page .	view
The following [MASK] lists the outcome of each view .	table
However , [MASK] can open the page in Design view and create additional group levels to make the page appear similar to the original object .	you
[MASK] on forms and reports need not have unique names , but names of controls on a page must be unique .	Controls
While creating the page , [MASK] will change control names that are not unique .	Access
However , [MASK] can open the page in Design view and change the property settings .	you
Much later , when he was able to think about the things that happened to him , [MASK] would conclude that nothing was real except chance .	he
But [MASK] was much later .	that
The [MASK] is the story itself , and whether or not it means something is not for the story to tell .	question
[MASK] know , for example , that he was thirty-five years old .	We
[MASK] know that he had once been married , had once been a father , and that both his wife and son were now dead .	We
[MASK] also know that he wrote books .	We
To be precise , [MASK] know that he wrote mystery novels .	we
Because he spent no more than five or six months on a novel , for the rest of the year [MASK] was free to do as he wished .	he
[MASK] read many books , he looked at paintings , he went to the movies .	He
In the summer [MASK] watched baseball on television ; in the winter he went to the opera .	he
Nearly every day , rain or shine , hot or cold , [MASK] would leave his apartment to walk through the city – never really going anywhere , but simply going wherever his legs happened to take him .	he
[MASK] York was an inexhaustible space , a labyrinth of endless steps , and no matter how far he walked , no matter how well he came to know its neighborhoods and streets , it always left him with the feeling of being lost .	New
Each time he took a walk , [MASK] felt as though he were leaving himself behind , and by giving himself up to the movement of the streets , by reducing himself to a seeing eye , he was able to escape the obligation to think , and this , more than anything else , brought him a measure of peace , a salutatory emptiness within .	he
The [MASK] was outside of him , around him , before him , and the speed with which it kept changing made it impossible for him to dwell on any one thing for very long .	world
[MASK] was of the essence , the act of putting one foot in front of the other and allowing himself to follow the drift of his own body .	Motion
By wandering aimlessly , all [MASK] became equal , and it no longer mattered where he was .	places
On his best walks , [MASK] was able to feel that he was nowhere .	he
[MASK] York was the nowhere he had built around himself , and he realized that he had no intention of ever leaving it again .	New
In the past , [MASK] had been more ambitious .	Quinn
As a young man , [MASK] had published several books of poetry , had written plays , critical essays , and had worked on a number of long translations .	he
But quite abruptly , [MASK] had given up all that .	he
A part of him had died , [MASK] told his friends , and he did not want it coming back to haunt him .	he
[MASK] was no longer that part of him that could write books , and although in many ways Quinn continued to exist , he no longer existed for anyone but himself .	Quinn
The next morning , [MASK] woke up earlier than he had in several weeks .	Quinn
Even that [MASK] , ' his appointment ' , seemed odd to him .	locution
[MASK] was n't his appointment , it was Paul Auster 's .	It
And who that person was [MASK] had no idea .	he
Nevertheless , as time wore on [MASK] found himself doing a good imitation of a man preparing to go out .	he
[MASK] cleared the table of the breakfast dishes , tossed the newspaper on the couch , went into the bathroom , showered , shaved , went on to the bedroom wrapped in two towels , opened the closet and picked out his clothes for the day .	He
[MASK] found himself tending toward a jacket and a tie .	He
[MASK] had not worn a tie since the funerals of his wife and son , and he could not even remember if he still owned one .	Quinn
But there [MASK] was , hanging amidst the debris of his wardrobe .	it
[MASK] dismissed a white shirt as too formal , however , and instead chose a gray and red check affair to go with the gray tie .	He
[MASK] put them on in a kind of trance .	He
I seem to be going out , [MASK] said to himself .	he
But if I am going out , where exactly am [MASK] going ?	I
An hour later , as he climbed from the number 4 bus at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue , [MASK] still had not answered the question .	he
[MASK] thought for a moment of Vermeer 's Soldier and Young Girl Smiling , trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man .	He
In his mind , [MASK] caught a glimpse of the blue map on the wall and the sunlight pouring through the window , so like the sunlight that surrounded him now .	he
[MASK] was walking .	He
[MASK] was crossing the street and moving eastward .	He
At Madison Avenue [MASK] turned right and went south for a block , then turned left and saw where he was .	he
I seem to have arrived , [MASK] said to himself .	he
[MASK] stood before the building and paused .	He
[MASK] suddenly did not seem to matter anymore .	It
[MASK] felt remarkably calm , as if everything had already happened to him .	He
As he opened the door that would lead him into the lobby , [MASK] gave himself one last word of advice .	he
If all this is really happening , [MASK] said , then I must keep my eyes open .	he
For some reason , [MASK] had not expected this , and it threw him off track .	Quinn
Already , [MASK] were happening too fast .	things
Before he had a chance to absorb the woman 's presence , to describe her to himself and form his impressions , [MASK] was talking to him , forcing him to respond .	she
Therefore , even in those first moments , [MASK] had lost ground , was starting to fall behind himself .	he
Later , when he had time to reflect on these events , [MASK] would manage to piece together his encounter with the woman .	he
But [MASK] was the work of memory , and remembered things , he knew , had a tendency to subvert the things remembered .	that
As a consequence , [MASK] could never be sure of any of it .	he
The [MASK] was thirty , perhaps thirty-five ; average height at best ; hips a touch wide , or else voluptuous , depending on your point of view ; dark hair , dark eyes , and a look in those eyes that was at once self-contained and vaguely seductive .	woman
[MASK] wore a black dress and very red lipstick .	She
[MASK] 'm Virginia Stillman , the woman began .	I
[MASK] 's been waiting for you since eight o'clock .	He
[MASK] was exactly ten .	It
He 's been frantic , the [MASK] explained .	woman
[MASK] 've never seen him like this before .	I
[MASK] just could n't wait .	He
[MASK] opened the door for Quinn .	She
As he crossed the threshold and entered the apartment , [MASK] could feel himself going blank , as if his brain had suddenly shut off .	he
[MASK] had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow beyond him at that moment .	He
The [MASK] loomed up around him as a kind of blur .	apartment
[MASK] realized that it was large , perhaps five or six rooms , and that it was richly furnished , with numerous art objects , silver ashtrays , and elaborately framed paintings on the walls .	He
But [MASK] was all .	that
[MASK] found himself sitting on a sofa , alone in the living room .	He
[MASK] remembered now that Mrs. Stillman had told him to wait there while she went to find her husband .	He
[MASK] could n't say how long it had been .	He
But from the way the light was coming through the windows , [MASK] seemed to be almost noon .	it
The [MASK] of Virginia Stillman 's perfume hovered around him , and he began to imagine what she looked like without any clothes on .	smell
Then [MASK] thought about what Max Work might have been thinking , had he been there .	he
[MASK] decided to light a cigarette .	He
[MASK] blew the smoke into the room .	He
[MASK] heard the sound of someone entering the room behind him .	He
[MASK] stood up from the sofa and turned around , expecting to see Mrs. Stillman .	Quinn
Instead , [MASK] was a young man , dressed entirely in white , with the white-blond hair of a child .	it
Uncannily , in that first moment , [MASK] thought of his own dead son .	Quinn
Then , just as suddenly as the thought had appeared , [MASK] vanished .	it
[MASK] Stillman walked into the room and sat down in a red velvet armchair opposite Quinn .	Peter
[MASK] said not a word as he made his way to his seat , nor did he acknowledge Quinn 's presence .	He
The [MASK] of moving from one place to another seemed to require all his attention , as though not to think of what he was doing would reduce him to immobility .	act
[MASK] had never seen anyone move in such a manner , and he realized at once that this was the same person he had spoken to on the phone .	Quinn
The [MASK] acted almost exactly as the voice had : machine-like , fitful , alternating between slow and rapid gestures , rigid and yet expressive , as if the operation were out of control , not quite corresponding to the will that lay behind it .	body
[MASK] seemed to Quinn that Stillman 's body had not been used for a long time and that all its functions had been relearned , so that motion had become a conscious process , each movement broken down into its component submovements , with the result that all flow and spontaneity had been lost .	It
[MASK] was like watching a marionette trying to walk without strings .	It
[MASK] about Peter Stillman was white .	Everything
Against the pallor of his skin , the flaxen thinness of his hair , the [MASK] was almost transparent , as though one could see through to the blue veins behind the skin of his face .	effect
This [MASK] was almost the same as his eyes : a milky blue that seemed to dissolve into a mixture of sky and clouds .	blue
[MASK] could not imagine himself addressing a word to this person .	Quinn
[MASK] settled slowly into his chair and at last turned his attention to Quinn .	Stillman
As their eyes met , [MASK] suddenly felt that Stillman had become invisible .	Quinn
[MASK] could see him sitting in the chair across from him , but at the same time it felt as though he was not there .	He
But no , [MASK] did not seem possible .	that
The [MASK] was looking at him , even studying him , and if recognition did not flicker across his face , it still held something more than a blank stare .	man
[MASK] did not know what to do .	Quinn
[MASK] sat there dumbly in his seat , looking back at Stillman .	He
A long [MASK] passed .	time
No questions , please , the young [MASK] said at last .	man
[MASK] paused for a moment .	He
[MASK] say this of my free will . Yes .	I
[MASK] is not my real name . No .	That
Of course , my [MASK] is not all it should be .	mind
[MASK] sit here and think : who is this person talking to me ?	You
[MASK] will tell you .	I
Or else [MASK] will not tell you .	I
At the corner of 72nd Street and Madison Avenue , [MASK] waved down a cab .	he
As the car rattled through the park toward the West Side , [MASK] looked out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light .	Quinn
[MASK] wondered if Peter saw the same things as he did , or whether the world was a different place for him .	He
And if a tree was not a tree , [MASK] wondered what it really was .	he
After the cab had dropped him off in front of his house , [MASK] realized that he was hungry .	Quinn
[MASK] had not eaten since breakfast early that morning .	He
It was strange , [MASK] thought , how quickly time had passed in the Stillman apartment .	he
If his calculations were correct , [MASK] had been there for more than fourteen hours .	he
Within himself , however , [MASK] felt as though his stay had lasted three or four hours at most .	it
[MASK] shrugged at the discrepancy and said to himself , I must learn to look at my watch more often .	He
[MASK] retraced his path along 107th Street , turned left on Broadway , and began walking uptown , looking for a suitable place to eat .	He
A [MASK] did not appeal to him tonight – eating in the dark , the press of boozy chatter – although normally he would have welcomed it .	bar
As he crossed 112th Street , [MASK] saw that the Heights Luncheonette was still open and decided to go in .	he
[MASK] was a brightly lit yet dreary place , with a large rack of girlie magazines on one wall , an area for stationery supplies , another area for newspapers , several tables for patrons , and a long Formica counter with swivel stools .	It
A tall Puerto Rican [MASK] in a white cardboard chef 's hat stood behind the counter .	man
[MASK] sat there impassively , reading the night-owl edition of the next morning 's Daily News .	He
[MASK] would arrive early , never later than seven o'clock and sit there with a take-out coffee , a buttered roll , and an open newspaper on his lap , watching the glass door of the hotel .	He
By eight o'clock [MASK] would come out , always in his long brown overcoat , carrying a large , old-fashioned carpet bag .	Stillman
For two weeks this [MASK] did not vary . The old man would wander through the streets of the neighborhood , advancing slowly , sometimes by the merest of increments , pausing , moving on again , pausing once more , as though each step had to be weighed and measured before it could take its place among the sum total of steps .	routine
[MASK] was hare in pursuit of the tortoise , and again and again he had to remind himself to hold back .	He
[MASK] could , of course , see with his own eyes what happened , and all these things he dutifully recorded in his red notebook . But the meaning of these things continued to elude him .	He
[MASK] never seemed to be going anywhere in particular , nor did he seem to know where he was .	Stillman
and yet , as if by conscious design , [MASK] kept to a narrowly circumscribed area , bounded on the north by Riverside Park , and on the east by Amsterdam Avenue .	he
No matter how haphazard his journeys seemed to be – and each day his itinerary was different – [MASK] never crossed these borders .	Stillman
Such [MASK] baffled Quinn , for in all other respects Stillman seemed to be aimless .	precision
As he walked , [MASK] did not look up .	Stillman
Indeed , every now and then [MASK] would stoop down , pick some object off the ground , and examine it closely , turning it over and over in his hand .	he
[MASK] made Quinn think of an archeologist inspecting a shard at some prehistoric ruin .	It
Occasionally , after poring over an object in this way , [MASK] would toss it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it .	Stillman
Then , reaching into one of his coat pockets , [MASK] would remove a red notebook – similar to Quinn 's but smaller – and write in it with great concentration for a minute or two .	he
Having completed this operation , [MASK] would return the notebook to his pocket , pick up his bag , and continue on his way .	he
As far as Quinn could tell , the [MASK] Stillman collected were valueless .	objects
[MASK] seemed to be no more than broken things , discarded things , stray bits of junk .	They
Over the days that passed , [MASK] noted a collapsible umbrella shorn of its material , the severed head of a rubber doll , a black glove , the bottom of a shattered light bulb , several pieces of printed matter ( sogged magazines , shredded newspapers ) , a torn photograph , anonymous machinery parts , and sundry other clumps of flotsam he could not identify .	Quinn
The [MASK] that Stillman took this scavenging seriously intrigued Quinn , but he could do no more than observe , write down what he saw in the red notebook , hover stupidly on the surface of things .	fact
[MASK] suspected that Stillman 's red notebook contained answers to the questions that had been accumulating in his mind , and he began to plot various stratagems for stealing it from the old man .	Quinn
But the [MASK] had not yet come for such a step .	time
Other than picking up objects from the street , [MASK] seemed to do nothing .	Stillman
Every now and then [MASK] would stop somewhere for a meal .	he
Occasionally [MASK] would bump into someone and mumble an apology .	he
Once a [MASK] nearly ran him over as he was crossing the street .	car
[MASK] did not talk to anyone , did not go into any stores , did not smile .	Stillman
[MASK] seemed neither happy nor sad .	He
Twice , when his scavenging haul had been unusually large , [MASK] returned to the hotel in the middle of the day and remerged a few minutes later with an empty bag .	he
On most days [MASK] spent at least several hours in Riverside Park , walking methodically along the macadam footpaths or else thrashing through the bushes with a stick .	he
His [MASK] for objects did not abate amidst the greenery .	quest
Stones , leaves , and twigs [MASK] found their way into his bag .	all
Once , Quinn observed , [MASK] even stooped down for a dried dog turd , sniffed it carefully , and kept it .	he
In the afternoon , often following his lunch , [MASK] would sit on a bench and gaze out across the Hudson .	he
Once , on a particularly warm day , [MASK] saw him sprawled out on the grass asleep .	Quinn
When darkness came , [MASK] would eat dinner at the Apollo Coffee Shop on 97th Street and Broadway and then return to his hotel for the night .	Stillman
Not once did [MASK] try to contact his son .	he
The essential [MASK] was to stay involved .	thing
Little by little , [MASK] began to feel cut off from his original intentions , and he wondered now if he had not embarked on a meaningless project .	Quinn
But [MASK] would assume he was aware of being watched , and Quinn felt that was unlikely .	that
[MASK] had done his job well so far , keeping at a discreet distance from the old man , blending into the traffic of the street , neither calling attention to himself nor taking drastic measures to keep himself hidden .	He
On the other hand , [MASK] was possible that Stillman had known all along that he would be watched – had even known it in advance – and therefore had not taken the trouble to discover who the particular watcher was .	it
If being followed was a certainty , what did [MASK] matter ?	it
This [MASK] of the situation comforted Quinn , and he decided to believe in it , even though he had no grounds for belief .	view
Either [MASK] knew what he was doing or he did n't .	Stillman
and if he did n't , then [MASK] was going nowhere , was wasting his time .	Quinn
If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then [MASK] would accept this knowledge as an article of faith , at least for the time being .	Quinn
His [MASK] through the city had taught him to understand the connectedness of inner and outer .	excursions
Using aimless motion as a technique of reversal , on his best days [MASK] could bring the outside in and thus usurp the sovereignty of inwardness .	he
By flooding himself with externals , by drowning himself out of himself , [MASK] had managed to exert some small degree of control over his fits of despair .	he
[MASK] could wander , he could stagger like a blindman from one spot to another , but this was a privilege denied to Quinn .	Stillman
For [MASK] was obliged now to concentrate on what he was doing , even if it was next to nothing .	he
Time and again his [MASK] would begin to drift , and soon thereafter his steps would follow suit .	thoughts
[MASK] meant that he was constantly in danger of quickening his pace and crashing into Stillman from behind .	This
To guard against this mishap [MASK] devised several different methods of deceleration .	he
The [MASK] was to tell himself that he was no longer Daniel Quinn .	first
[MASK] was no more than a name to him , a husk without content .	Auster
To be [MASK] meant being a man with no interior , a man with no thoughts .	Auster
The old [MASK] had become part of the city .	man
[MASK] was a speck , a punctuation mark , a brick in an endless wall of bricks .	He
[MASK] could walk through the streets every day for the rest of his life , and still he would not find him .	Quinn
[MASK] backtracked in his mind to the beginning of the case .	Quinn
His [MASK] had been to protect Peter , not to follow Stillman .	job
[MASK] had simply been a method , a way of trying to predict what would happen .	That
By watching Stillman , the [MASK] was that he would learn what his intentions were toward Peter .	theory
[MASK] had followed the old man for two weeks .	He
What , then , could [MASK] conclude ?	he
Stillman 's [MASK] had been too obscure to give any hints .	behavior
[MASK] could suggest to Virginia Stillman that she get an unlisted telephone number .	He
[MASK] would eliminate the disturbing calls , at least temporarily .	That
If that failed , [MASK] and Peter could move .	she
[MASK] could leave the neighborhood , perhaps leave the city altogether .	They
At the very worst , [MASK] could take on new identities , live under different names .	they
This last [MASK] reminded him of something important .	thought
Until now , [MASK] realized , he had never seriously questioned the circumstances of his hiring .	he
[MASK] had happened too quickly , and he had taken it for granted that he could fill in for Paul Auster .	Things
Once he had taken the leap into that name , [MASK] had stopped thinking about Auster himself .	he
If this man was as good a detective as the Stillmans thought he was , perhaps [MASK] would be able to help with the case .	he
[MASK] would make a clean breast of it , Auster would forgive him , and together they would work to save Peter Stillman .	Quinn
[MASK] looked through the yellow pages for the Auster Detective Agency .	He
In the white pages , however , [MASK] found the name .	he
[MASK] picked up the phone and was about to dial when he thought better of it .	Quinn
[MASK] was too important a conversation to leave to the phone .	This
[MASK] did not want to run the risk of being brushed off .	He
Since Auster did not have an office , [MASK] meant he worked at home .	that
[MASK] would go there and talk to him face to face .	Quinn
The [MASK] had stopped now , and although the sky was still gray , far to the west Quinn could see a tiny shift of light seeping through the clouds .	rain
As he walked up Riverside Drive , [MASK] became aware of the fact that he was no longer following Stillman .	he
[MASK] felt as though he had lost half of himself .	It
Whatever Stillman had done , [MASK] had done ; wherever Stillman had gone , he had gone .	he
The [MASK] was over , and yet his body did not know it .	spell
Auster 's [MASK] was in the middle of the long block that ran between 116th and 119th Streets , just south of Riverside Church and Grant 's Tomb .	building
[MASK] was a well-kept place , with polished doorknobs and clean glass , and it had an air of bourgeois sobriety that appealed to Quinn at that moment .	It
Auster 's [MASK] was on the eleventh floor , and Quinn rang the buzzer , expecting to hear a voice speak to him through the intercom .	apartment
But the door [MASK] answered him without any conversation .	buzzer
[MASK] pushed the door open , walked through the lobby , and rode the elevator to the eleventh floor .	Quinn
[MASK] was a tall dark fellow in his mid-thirties , with rumpled clothes and a two-day beard .	He
In his right hand , fixed between his thumb and first two fingers , [MASK] held an uncapped fountain pen , still poised in a writing position .	he
The [MASK] seemed surprised to find a stranger standing before him .	man
Yes ? [MASK] asked tentatively .	he
[MASK] spoke in the politest tone he could muster . Were you expecting someone else ?	Quinn
That 's why [MASK] rang the buzzer without asking who it was .	I
[MASK] 'm sorry to disturb you , Quinn apologized . But I 'm looking for Paul Auster .	I
[MASK] wonder if I could talk to you . It 's quite important .	I
[MASK] 'll have to tell me what it 's about first .	You
[MASK] hardly know myself . Quinn gave Auster an honest look .	I
[MASK] 's complicated , I 'm afraid . Very complicated .	It
Do [MASK] have a name ?	you
[MASK] 'm sorry . Of course I do . Quinn .	I
The [MASK] seemed to suggest something to Auster , and he paused for a moment abstractedly , as if searching through his memory .	name
Quinn , [MASK] muttered to himself .	he
[MASK] know that name from somewhere . He went silent again , straining harder to dredge up the answer .	I
[MASK] are n't a poet , are you ?	You
[MASK] did a book several years ago , did n't you ?	You
[MASK] think the title was Unfinished Business .	I
Yes . [MASK] was me .	That
[MASK] liked it very much .	I
[MASK] kept hoping to see more of your work .	I
In fact , [MASK] even wondered what had happened to you .	I
[MASK] 'm still here . Sort of .	I
[MASK] opened the door wider and gestured for Quinn to enter the apartment .	Auster
[MASK] was a pleasant enough place inside ; oddly shaped , with several long corridors , books cluttered everywhere , pictures on the walls by artists Quinn did not know , and a few children 's toys scattered on the floor – a red truck , a brown bear , a green space monster .	It
[MASK] led him to the living room , gave him a frayed upholstered chair to sit in , and then went off to the kitchen to fetch some beer .	Auster
[MASK] returned with two bottles , placed them on a wooden crate that served as the coffee table , and sat down on the sofa across from Quinn .	He
Was it some kind of literary thing you wanted to talk about ? [MASK] began .	Auster
In the end , [MASK] are actually successful .	they
The [MASK] was just one of their ploys .	book
The [MASK] was to hold a mirror up to Don Quixote 's madness to record each of his absurd and ludicrous delusions , so that when he finally read the book himself , he would see the error of his ways .	idea
[MASK] like that .	I
[MASK] Quixote , in my view , was not really mad .	Don
[MASK] only pretended to be .	He
In fact , [MASK] orchestrated the whole thing himself .	he
Again and again [MASK] wonders how accurately his chronicler will record his adventures .	he
[MASK] implies knowledge on his part ; he knows beforehand that this chronicler exists .	This
And [MASK] else is it but Sancho Panza , the faithful squire whom Don Quixote has chosen for exactly this purpose ?	who
In the same way , [MASK] chose the three others to play the roles he destined for them .	he
And not only did [MASK] select the authors , it was probably he who translated the Arabic manuscript back into Spanish .	he
[MASK] should n't put it past him .	We
[MASK] like to imagine that scene in the marketplace at Toledo .	I
[MASK] hiring Don Quixote to decipher the story of Don Quixote himself .	Cervantes
[MASK] 's the most interesting part of all .	That
In my opinion , [MASK] Quixote was conducting an experiment .	Don
[MASK] wanted to test the gullibility of his fellow men .	He
Would [MASK] be possible to persuade others to agree with what he said , even though they did not believe him ?	it
In other words , to what extent would [MASK] tolerate blasphemies if they gave them amusement ?	people
The [MASK] is obvious , is n't it ?	answer
For the proof is that [MASK] still read the book .	we
[MASK] remains highly amusing to us .	It
And [MASK] 's finally all anyone wants out of a book – to be amused .	that
[MASK] leaned back on the sofa , smiled with a certain ironic pleaure , and lit a cigarette .	Auster
The [MASK] was obviously enjoying himself , but the precise nature of that pleasure eluded Quinn .	man
[MASK] seemed to be a kind of soundless laughter , a joke that stopped short of its punchline , a generalized mirth that had no object .	It
[MASK] was about to say something in response to Auster 's theory , but he was not given the chance .	Quinn
Auster 's [MASK] perked up at the sound .	face
[MASK] rose from his seat , excused himself to Quinn , and walked quickly towards the door .	He
[MASK] heard laughter in the hallway , first from a woman and then from a child – the high and the higher , a staccato of ringing shrapnel – and then the basso rumbling of Auster 's guffaw .	Quinn
The [MASK] spoke : Daddy , look what I found !	child
And then the [MASK] explained that it had been lying on the street , and why not , it seemed perfectly okay .	woman
A moment later [MASK] heard the child running towards him down the hall . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks .	he
[MASK] was a blond-haired boy of five or six .	He
The [MASK] , rapidly withdrawing into shyness , managed no more than a faint hello .	boy
In his left hand [MASK] held a red object that Quinn could not identify .	he
[MASK] asked the boy what it was .	Quinn
[MASK] 's a yoyo , he answered , opening his hand to show him .	It
[MASK] found it on the street .	I
Does [MASK] work ?	it
The [MASK] gave an exaggerated pantomine shrug .	boy
[MASK] ca n't do it . And I do n't know how .	Siri
[MASK] asked him if he could try , and the boy walked over and put it in his hand .	Quinn
As he examined the yoyo , [MASK] could hear the child breathing beside him , watching his every move .	he
The [MASK] was plastic , similar to the ones he had played with years ago , but more elaborate somehow , an artifact of the space age .	yoyo
[MASK] fastened the loop at the end of the string around his middle finger , stood up , and gave it a try .	Quinn
The [MASK] gave off a fluted , whistling sound as it descended , and sparks shot off inside it .	yoyo
The [MASK] gasped , but then the yoyo stopped , dangling at the end of the line .	boy
A great [MASK] once said , muttered Quinn , that the way up and the way down are one and the same .	philosopher
[MASK] only went down .	It
[MASK] have to keep trying .	You
[MASK] was rewinding the spool for another attempt when Auster and his wife entered the room .	Quinn
[MASK] looked up and saw the woman first .	He
In that one brief moment [MASK] knew that he was in trouble .	he
[MASK] was a tall , thin blonde , radiantly beautiful , with an energy and happiness that seemed to make everything around her invisible .	She
[MASK] was too much for Quinn .	It
[MASK] felt as though Auster were taunting him with the things he had lost , and he responded with envy and rage , a lacerating self-pity .	He
Yes , [MASK] too would have liked to have this wife and this child , to sit around all day spouting drivel about old books , to be surrounded by yoyos and ham omelettes and fountain pens .	he
[MASK] prayed to himself for deliverance .	He
[MASK] saw the yoyo in his hands and said , I see you 've already met .	Auster
Daniel , [MASK] said to the boy , this is Daniel .	he
The [MASK] burst out laughing and said , Everybody 's Daniel !	boy
[MASK] 'm you , and you 're me .	I
And [MASK] , said Auster , turning to the woman , is my wife , Siri .	this
The [MASK] smiled her smile , said she was glad to meet Quinn as though she meant it , and then extended her hand to him .	wife
[MASK] shook it , feeling the uncanny slenderness of her bones , and asked if her name was Norwegian .	He
Not many people know that , [MASK] said .	she
Do [MASK] come from Norway ?	you
Indirectly , [MASK] said . By way of Northfield , Minnesota .	she
And then [MASK] laughed her laugh , and Quinn felt a little more of himself collapse .	she
[MASK] was nowhere now .	Quinn
[MASK] had nothing , he knew nothing , he knew that he knew nothing .	He
His [MASK] read nearly six .	watch
[MASK] walked home the way he had come , lengthening his strides with each new block .	Quinn
By the time he came to his street , [MASK] was running .	he
It 's June second , [MASK] told himself .	he
If all goes well , the following [MASK] will be the fourth .	day
But [MASK] is certain .	nothing
The [MASK] had long since passed for his call to Virginia Stillman , and he debated whether to go through with it .	hour
Could [MASK] abandon everything now , just like that ?	he
Yes , [MASK] said to himself , it was possible .	he
[MASK] could forget about the case , get back to his routine , write another book .	He
[MASK] could take a trip if he liked , even leave the country for a while .	He
[MASK] could go to Paris , for example .	He
Yes , [MASK] was possible .	that
But [MASK] would do , he thought , anywhere at all .	anywhere
[MASK] sat down in his living room and looked at the walls .	He
They had once been white , [MASK] remembered , but now they had turned a curious shade of yellow .	he
Perhaps one day [MASK] would drift further into dinginess , lasping into gray , or even brown , like some pieces of aging fruit .	they
A white wall becomes a yellow wall becomes a gray wall , [MASK] said to himself .	he
The [MASK] becomes exhausted , the city encroaches with its soot , the plaster crumbles within .	paint
[MASK] smoked a cigarette , and then another , and then another .	He
[MASK] looked at his hands , saw that they were dirty , and got up to wash them .	He
In the bathroom , with the water running in the sink , [MASK] decided to shave as well .	he
[MASK] lathered his face , took out a clean blade , and started scraping off his beard .	He
For some reason , [MASK] found it unpleasant to look in the mirror and kept trying to avoid himself with his eyes .	he
You 're getting old , [MASK] said to himself , you 're turning into an old fart .	he
Then [MASK] went into the kitchen , ate a bowl of cornflakes , and smoked another cigarette .	he
[MASK] was seven o'clock now .	It
Once again , [MASK] debated whether to call Virginia Stillman .	he
[MASK] saw the argument for making the call , and at the same time he saw the argument for not making it .	He
After that , [MASK] would be perfectly acceptable .	it
As long as you tell people what you are going to do , he reasoned , [MASK] does n't matter .	it
Then [MASK] are free to do what you want .	you
The [MASK] , however , was busy .	number
[MASK] waited five minutes and dialed again .	He
Again , the [MASK] was busy .	number
For the next hour [MASK] alternated between dialing and waiting , always with the same result .	Quinn
At last [MASK] called the operator and asked whether the phone was out of order .	he
[MASK] tried to imagine what the operators looked like .	Quinn
Then the first [MASK] spoke again : the number was busy .	woman
[MASK] did not know what to think .	Quinn
[MASK] turned on the television and watched the first two innings of the Mets game .	He
Then [MASK] dialed once again .	he
In the top of the third [MASK] Louis scored on a walk , a stolen base , an infield out , and a sacrifice fly .	St.
The [MASK] matched that run in their half of the inning on a double by Wilson and a single by Youngblood .	Mets
[MASK] realized that he did n't care .	Quinn
A beer [MASK] came on , and he turned off the sound .	commercial
For the twentieth time the same [MASK] happened .	thing
In the top of the fourth [MASK] Louis scored five runs , and Quinn turned off the picture as well .	St.
[MASK] found his red notebook , sat down at his desk , and wrote steadily for the next two hours .	He
[MASK] did not bother to read over what he had written .	He
Then [MASK] called Virginia Stillman and got another busy signal .	he
[MASK] slammed the receiver down so hard that the plastic cracked .	He
When he tried to call again , [MASK] could no longer get a dial tone .	he
[MASK] stood up , went into the kitchen , and made another bowl of cornflakes .	He
Then [MASK] went to bed .	he
In his dream , which he later forgot , [MASK] found himself walking down Broadway , holding Auster 's son by the hand .	he
Security [MASK] are strict on flights to Israel , the bags are searched , the men are frisked , and the women have an electronic hoop passed over them , fore-and-aft .	measures

Some two hundred [MASK] are flying to Israel to attend the circumcision of the firstborn son of their spiritual leader , the Belzer Rabbi .	Hasidim
At the age of six , [MASK] myself wore a tallith katan , or scapular , under my shirt , only mine was a scrap of green calico print , whereas theirs are white linen .	I

Our [MASK] is in his late twenties .	Hasid

[MASK] and impulses other than civilized fill it by no means inferior impulses and thoughts .	Thoughts
And though he is not permitted to sit beside women unrelated to him or to look at them or to communicate with them in any manner ( all of which probably saves him a great deal of trouble ) , [MASK] seems a good-hearted young man and he is visibly enjoying himself .	he
All the [MASK] are vividly enjoying themselves , dodging through the aisles , visiting chattering standing impatiently in the long lavatory lines , amiable , busy as geese .	Hasidim
[MASK] pay no attention to signs .	They
Do n't [MASK] understand English ?	they
The [MASK] are furious with them .	stewardesses
[MASK] ask one of the hostesses when I may expect to receive a drink and she cries out in irritation , " Back to your seat ! "	I
[MASK] says this in so ringing a voice that I retreat .	She
The [MASK] given by these young gentile uniformed females are nothing to them .	orders
To them [MASK] are merely attendants , exotic bediener , all but bodyless .	they
Anticipating a difficulty , [MASK] ask the stewardess to serve me a kosher lunch .	I
" I ca n't do that , we have n't enough for them , " [MASK] says .	she
" [MASK] 've got to go out of our way to Rome for more of their special meals . "	We
Amused , my [MASK] asks why I ordered the kosher lunch .	wife
" Because when they bring my chicken dinner this [MASK] with the beard will be in a state , " I explain .	kid
And so [MASK] is .	he
The British Airways [MASK] with the chill of death upon it lies before me .	chicken
But after three hours of security exercises at Heathrow [MASK] am hungry .	I
The young [MASK] recoils when the tray is handed to me .	Hasid
[MASK] addresses me again in Yiddish .	He
[MASK] says , " I must talk to you .	He
" No , [MASK] do n't think so . "	I
" [MASK] may want to give me a slap in the face . "	You
" [MASK] are a Jew .	You

" [MASK] does n't speak Yiddish ? "	She
But excuse me , [MASK] want my lunch . "	I
" Will [MASK] eat some of my kosher food instead , as a favor ? "	you
" Then [MASK] will give you a sandwich , but only on one condition .	I
[MASK] must never never eat trephena food again . "	You

" Of course [MASK] will . "	I
If you will eat nothing but kosher food , for the rest of your life [MASK] will send you fifteen dollars a week . "	I
" That 's very generous , " [MASK] say .	I
" Well , you are a Jew , " [MASK] says .	he

" [MASK] can go as far as twenty-five . "	I
" [MASK] ca n't accept such a sacrifice from you . "	I
Shrugging , [MASK] gives up and I turn to the twice disagreeable chicken and eat guiltily , my appetite spoiled .	he
The young [MASK] opens his prayer book .	Hasid
" [MASK] wonder if he 's praying for you . "	I
[MASK] smiles at my discomfiture .	She
As soon as the trays are removed , the [MASK] block the aisles with their Minchah service , rocking themselves and stretching their necks upward .	Hasidim

Right where [MASK] are standing .	we
[MASK] find in Elie Kedourie 's Arabic Political Memoirs facts unknown to most about American diplomacy in the late forties .	I
Certainly [MASK] did n't know them .	I
In the Middle East and probably elsewhere , the [MASK] States relied heavily on management consultants and public-relations experts .	United
The American [MASK] of Booz , Allen &amp; Hamilton lent one of its specialists , Miles Copeland by name , to the State Department , where he was in 1955 a member of a group called the Middle East Policy Planning Committee , the main purpose of which was , in his own words , " to work out ways of taking advantage of the friendship which was developing between ourselves and Nasser .

Spreading democracy over the world , the [MASK] first fought rigged elections in Syria , but the old corruption continued despite all their power and money could do .	Americans
Frustrated , the [MASK] decided for the best of reasons , as always , to make a heavier move :	Americans

Failing in Syria , the [MASK] went to work in Egypt .	Americans

The [MASK] wanted the new regime to make the populace literate , to create " a large and stable middle class a sufficient identification of local ideals and values , so that truly indigenous democratic institutions could grow up . "	Americans
Gliding into a new political realm , the [MASK] arranged for loans to the Egyptian government .	Americans
[MASK] believed that genuine democracy was now on its way .	They
This [MASK] , called " Power Problems of a Revolutionary Government , " went back-and-forth , according to Mr Copeland , " between English and Arabic until a final version was produced .	document

[MASK] must now believe that the same romantic conviction has been alive somewhere in the offices of J Walter Thompson .	We
The [MASK] States is , after all , the prime revolutionary country .	United
Or was Mr [MASK] simply an executive with a client to please and a job to do a pure professional ?	Eichelberger
[MASK] is a shocking suspicion .	This
Of course the [MASK] written by Mr Eichelberger and his Egyptian collaborators states that the purpose of the Nasser seizure of power was " to solve the pressing social and political problems which made the revolution necessary . "	paper

At times [MASK] suspect that the world would be glad to see the last of its Christianity , and that it is the persistency of the Jews that prevents it .	I

Back at sea , [MASK] had to stand double watches in the engine room because he was shorthanded .	John
Off duty , [MASK] read in his cabin and chatted with his confidante , Mississippi .	he
The [MASK] said he was drinking himself silly in his quarters .	crew
But an [MASK] from the island , disturbed by the sparks , flew out to the ship and was discovered next day on the mast .	owl
[MASK] of the young sailors carried it down .	One
Then an engine [MASK] from the Balkans said , " In our village we nailed owls to the church door when we caught them . "	man
[MASK] shut the owl in the paint locker while they debated what to do with it , and in the night John set it free .	They
The [MASK] scratched his arm rather badly .	bird
" Go back to Stromboli , you dumb bastard , " [MASK] said .	he
So [MASK] flew off and the ship continued on its foul way .	it
Before I left Chicago , the art critic [MASK] Rosenberg said to me , " Going to Jerusalem ?	Harold
[MASK] 've got to be kidding , they 'll talk your head off . "	You
[MASK] spoke as a Jew to a Jew about Jewish powers of speech .	He
Here in Jerusalem , when you shut your apartment door behind you [MASK] fall into a gale of conversation exposition , argument , harangue , analysis , theory , expostulation , threat , and prophecy .	you
From diplomats [MASK] hear cagey explanations ;	you
[MASK] listen carefully , closely , more closely than I 've ever listened in my life , utterly attentive , but I often feel that I have dropped into a shoreless sea .	I
The [MASK] of all this talk is , ultimately , survival the survival of the decent society created in Israel within a few decades .	subject
At first [MASK] is hard to grasp because the setting is so civilized .	this
[MASK] are in a city like many another well , not quite , for Jerusalem is the only ancient city I 've ever seen whose antiquities are not on display as relics but are in daily use .	You
Still , the [MASK] is a modern city with modern utilities .	city
[MASK] shop in supermarkets , you say good morning to friends on the telephone , you hear symphony orchestras on the radio .	You
But suddenly the [MASK] stops and a terrorist bomb is reported .	music
Uneasy , [MASK] go out to your civilized dinner .	you
[MASK] are exploding everywhere .	Bombs
Yet here [MASK] sit at dinner with charming people in a dining room like any other .	you
[MASK] know that your hostess has lost a son ; that her sister lost children in the 1973 war ;	You
That in this Jerusalem street , coolly sweet with night flowers and dark green under the lamps , many other [MASK] have lost children .	families
And on the Jaffa Road , because of another bomb , six [MASK] two on a break from night school stopping at a coffee shop to eat buns , have just died .	adolescents
But in the domestic ceremony of passed dishes and filled glasses [MASK] of a destructive enemy are hard to grasp .	thoughts
[MASK] can ; you can not .	Others
[MASK] is not to say that everyone else is living pleasantly and well under a decent regime .	This
No , [MASK] means only that the Jews , because they are Jews , have never been able to take the right to live as a natural right .	it
To be sure , many [MASK] refuse to admit that this historic uneasiness has not been eliminated .	Israelis
[MASK] seem to think of themselves as a fixed power , immovable .	They
The [MASK] , a cruising yawl , swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails , and was at rest .	Nellie
The [MASK] had made , the wind was nearly calm , and being bound down the river , the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide .	flood
The [MASK] of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway .	sea-reach
A [MASK] rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness .	haze
The [MASK] was dark above Gravesend , and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom , brooding motionless over the biggest , and the greatest , town on earth .	air
The [MASK] of Companies was our captain and our host .	Director
[MASK] four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward .	We
[MASK] resembled a pilot , which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified .	He
Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation , [MASK] had the effect of making us tolerant of each other 's yarns – and even convictions .	it
The [MASK] – the best of old fellows – had , because of his many years and many virtues , the only cushion on deck , and was lying on the only rug .	Lawyer
The [MASK] had brought out already a box of dominoes , and was toying architecturally with the bones .	Accountant
[MASK] sat cross-legged right aft , leaning against the mizzen-mast .	Marlow
[MASK] had sunken cheeks , a yellow complexion , a straight back , an ascetic aspect , and , with his arms dropped , the palms of hands outwards , resembled an idol .	He
The [MASK] , satisfied the anchor had good hold , made his way aft and sat down amongst us .	Director
[MASK] exchanged a few words lazily .	We
For some reason or other [MASK] did not begin that game of dominoes .	we
[MASK] felt meditative , and fit for nothing but placid staring .	We
The [MASK] was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance .	day
The [MASK] shone pacifically ; the sky , without a speck , was a benign immensity of unstained light ; the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric , hung from the wooded rises inland , and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds .	water
Only the [MASK] to the west , brooding over the upper reaches , became more somber every minute , as if angered by the approach of the sun .	gloom
And at last , in its curved and imperceptible fall , the [MASK] sank low , and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat , as if about to go out suddenly , stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men .	sun
Forthwith a [MASK] came over the waters , and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound .	change
The old [MASK] in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day , after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks , spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth .	river
[MASK] looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever , but in the august light of abiding memories .	We
And indeed [MASK] is easier for a man who has , as the phrase goes , followed the sea with reverence and affection , than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames .	nothing
The tidal [MASK] runs to and fro in its unceasing service , crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea .	current
[MASK] had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud , from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin , knights all , titled and untitled – the great knights-errant of the sea .	It
[MASK] had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time , from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure , to be visited by the Queen 's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale , to the Erebus and Terror , bound on other conquests – and that never returned .	It
[MASK] had known the ships and the men .	It
[MASK] had sailed from Deptford , from Greenwich , from Erith – the adventurers and the settlers ; kings ' ships and the ships of men on Change ; captains , admirals , the dark " interlopers " of the Eastern trade , and the commissioned " generals " of East India fleets .	They
Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame , [MASK] all had gone out on that stream , bearing the sword , and often the torch , messengers of the might within the land , bearers of a spark from the sacred fire .	they
What [MASK] had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth ! ...	greatness
The [MASK] set ; the dusk fell on the stream , and lights began to appear along the shore .	sun
The Chapman [MASK] , a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat , shone strongly .	lighthouse
[MASK] of ships moved in the fairway – a great stir of lights going up and going down . And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky , a brooding gloom in sunshine , a lurid glare under the stars .	Lights
[MASK] was the only man of us who still followed the sea .	He
The worst that could be said of him was that [MASK] did not represent his class .	he
[MASK] was a seaman , but he was a wanderer , too , while most seamen lead , if one may so express it , a sedentary life .	He
Their [MASK] are of the stay-at-home order , and their home is always with them – the ship ; and so is their country – the sea .	minds
One [MASK] is very much like another , and the sea is always the same .	ship
In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign [MASK] , the foreign faces , the changing immensity of life , glide past , veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance ; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself , which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny .	shores
For the rest , after his hours of work , a casual [MASK] or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent , and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing .	stroll
The [MASK] of seamen have a direct simplicity , the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut .	yarns
But [MASK] was not typical ( if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted ) , and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside , enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze , in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine .	Marlow
His [MASK] did not seem at all surprising .	remark
[MASK] was just like Marlow . It was accepted in silence .	It
[MASK] one took the trouble to grunt even ; and presently he said , very slow –	No
[MASK] was thinking of very old times , when the Romans first came here , nineteen hundred years ago – the other day ... .	I
[MASK] came out of this river since – you say Knights ?	Light
Yes ; but [MASK] is like a running blaze on a plain , like a flash of lightning in the clouds .	it
[MASK] live in the flicker – may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling !	We
But [MASK] was here yesterday .	darkness
[MASK] must have been dying like flies here .	They
Oh yes – [MASK] did it .	he
[MASK] were men enough to face the darkness .	They
[MASK] has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible , which is also detestable .	He
And [MASK] has a fascination , too , that goes to work upon him .	it
[MASK] paused .	He
Mind , [MASK] began again , lifting one arm from the elbow , the palm of the hand outwards , so that , with his legs folded before him , he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower – Mind , none of us would feel exactly like this .	he
But these [MASK] were not much account , really .	chaps
[MASK] were no colonists ; their administration was merely a squeeze , and nothing more , I suspect .	They
[MASK] were conquerors , and for that you want only brute force – nothing to boast of , when you have it , since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others .	They
[MASK] grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got .	They
[MASK] was just robbery with violence , aggravated murder on a great scale , and men going at it blind – as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness .	It
The [MASK] of the earth , which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves , is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much .	conquest
[MASK] broke off .	He
[MASK] glided in the river , small green flames , red flames , white flames , pursuing , overtaking , joining , crossing each other – then separating slowly or hastily .	Flames
The [MASK] of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river .	traffic
[MASK] looked on , waiting patiently – there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood ; but it was only after a long silence , when he said , in a hesitating voice , I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit , that we knew we were fated , before the ebb began to run , to hear about one of Marlow 's inconclusive experiences .	We
I do n't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally [MASK] began , showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear ;	he
yet to understand the effect of it on me [MASK] ought to know how I got out there , what I saw , how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap .	you
[MASK] was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience .	It
[MASK] seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me – and into my thoughts .	It
[MASK] was somber enough too – and pitiful – not extraordinary in any way – not very clear either .	It
And yet [MASK] seemed to throw a kind of light .	it
[MASK] had then , as you remember , just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean , Pacific , China Seas – a regular dose of the East – six years or so , and I was loafing about , hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes , just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you .	I
[MASK] was very fine for a time , but after a bit I did get tired of resting .	It
Then [MASK] began to look for a ship – I should think the hardest work on earth .	I
But the [MASK] would n't even look at me .	ships
And [MASK] got tired of that game too .	I
Now when I was a little chap [MASK] had a passion for maps .	I
[MASK] would look for hours at South America , or Africa , or Australia , and lose myself in all the glories of exploration .	I
The North [MASK] was one of these places , I remember .	Pole
Well , [MASK] have n't been there yet , and shall not try now .	I
The [MASK] 's off .	glamour
[MASK] have been in some of them , and ... well , we wo n't talk about that .	I
True , by this time [MASK] was not a blank space any more .	it
[MASK] had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery – a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over .	It
[MASK] had become a place of darkness .	It
And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window , [MASK] fascinated me as a snake would a bird – a silly little bird .	it
Then [MASK] remembered there was a big concern , a Company for trade on that river .	I
Dash it all ! [MASK] thought to myself , they ca n't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water – steamboats !	I
Why should n't [MASK] try to get charge of one ?	I
[MASK] went on along Fleet Street , but could not shake off the idea .	I
The [MASK] had charmed me .	snake
[MASK] understand it was a Continental concern , that Trading society ; but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent , because it 's cheap and not so nasty as it looks , they say .	You
[MASK] ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit .	I
You forget , dear Charlie , that the laborer is worthy of his hire , [MASK] said , brightly .	she
[MASK] live in a world of their own , and there had never been anything like it , and never can be .	They
[MASK] is too beautiful altogether , and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset .	It
Some confounded [MASK] we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over .	fact
In the street – I do n't know why – a queer [MASK] came to me that I was an impostor .	feeling
The best [MASK] I can explain it to you is by saying that , for a second or two , I felt as though , instead of going to the center of a continent , I were about to set off for the center of the earth .	way
[MASK] left in a French steamer , and she called in every blamed port they have out there , for , as far as I could see , the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers .	I
[MASK] watched the coast .	I
There [MASK] is before you – smiling , frowning , inviting , grand , mean , insipid , or savage , and always mute with an air of whispering , ' Come and find out .	it
' This [MASK] was almost featureless , as if still in the making , with an aspect of monotonous grimness .	one
The [MASK] of a colossal jungle , so dark-green as to be almost black , fringed with white surf , ran straight , like a ruled line , far , far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist .	edge
The [MASK] was fierce , the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam .	sun
Here and there grayish-whitish [MASK] showed up , clustered inside the white surf , with a flag flying above them perhaps .	specks
[MASK] pounded along , stopped , landed soldiers ; went on , landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness , with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it ; landed more soldiers – to take care of the custom-house clerks , presumably .	We
Every day the [MASK] looked the same , as though we had not moved ; but we passed various places – trading places – with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo , names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth .	coast
The [MASK] of a passenger , my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact , the oily and languid sea , the uniform somberness of the coast , seemed to keep me away from the truth of things , within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion .	idleness
[MASK] was something natural , that had its reason , that had a meaning .	It
Now and then a [MASK] from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality .	boat
[MASK] could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening .	You
[MASK] shouted , sang ; their bodies streamed with perspiration ; they had faces like grotesque masks – these chaps ; but they had bone , muscle , a wild vitality , an intense energy of movement , that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast .	They
[MASK] wanted no excuse for being there . They were a great comfort to look at .	They
For a time [MASK] would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts ; but the feeling would not last long .	I
[MASK] would turn up to scare it away .	Something
Once , I remember , [MASK] came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast .	we
Her [MASK] dropped limp like a rag ; the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull ; the greasy , slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down , swaying her thin masts .	ensign
In the empty immensity of earth , sky , and water , there [MASK] was , incomprehensible , firing into a continent .	she
[MASK] could happen .	Nothing
[MASK] gave her her letters ( I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day ) and went on .	We
[MASK] called at some more places with farcical names , where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb ; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf , as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders ; in and out of rivers , streams of death in life , whose banks were rotting into mud , whose waters , thickened into slime , invaded the contorted mangroves , that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair .	We
Nowhere did [MASK] stop long enough to get a particularized impression , but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me .	we
[MASK] was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares .	It
[MASK] anchored off the seat of the government .	We
But my [MASK] would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on . So as soon as I could I made a start for a place thirty miles higher up .	work
[MASK] had my passage on a little sea-going steamer .	I
Her [MASK] was a Swede , and knowing me for a seaman , invited me on the bridge .	captain
[MASK] was a young man , lean , fair , and morose , with lanky hair and a shuffling gait .	He
As we left the miserable little wharf , [MASK] tossed his head contemptuously at the shore .	he
Been living there ? [MASK] asked .	he
[MASK] said , Yes .	I
[MASK] said to him I expected to see that soon .	I
So-o-o ! [MASK] exclaimed .	he
[MASK] shuffled athwart , keeping one eye ahead vigilantly .	He
The other day [MASK] took up a man who hanged himself on the road .	I
[MASK] was a Swede , too .	He
Why , in God 's name ? [MASK] cried .	I
[MASK] kept on looking out watchfully .	He
[MASK] knows ?	Who
The [MASK] too much for him , or the country perhaps .	sun
At last [MASK] opened a reach .	we
A rocky [MASK] appeared , mounds of turned-up earth by the shore , houses on a hill , others , with iron roofs , amongst a waste of excavations , or hanging to the declivity .	cliff
A continuous [MASK] of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation .	noise
A [MASK] of people , mostly black and naked , moved about like ants .	lot
A [MASK] projected into the river .	jetty
A blinding [MASK] drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare .	sunlight
' [MASK] will send your things up .	I
Four boxes did [MASK] say ?	you
' [MASK] came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass , then found a path leading up the hill .	I
[MASK] turned aside for the bowlders , and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air .	It
[MASK] was off .	One
The [MASK] looked as dead as the carcass of some animal .	thing
[MASK] came upon more pieces of decaying machinery , a stack of rusty rails .	I
[MASK] blinked , the path was steep .	I
A [MASK] tooted to the right , and I saw the black people run . A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground , a puff of smoke came out of the cliff , and that was all .	horn
No [MASK] appeared on the face of the rock .	change
[MASK] were building a railway .	They
The [MASK] was not in the way or anything ; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on .	cliff
Six black [MASK] advanced in a file , toiling up the path . They walked erect and slow , balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads , and the clink kept time with their footsteps .	men
[MASK] could see every rib , the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope ; each had an iron collar on his neck , and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them , rhythmically clinking .	I
Another [MASK] from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent .	report
[MASK] was the same kind of ominous voice ; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies .	It
All their meager [MASK] panted together , the violently dilated nostrils quivered , the eyes stared stonily uphill .	breasts
[MASK] passed me within six inches , without a glance , with that complete , deathlike indifference of unhappy savages .	They
Behind this raw matter [MASK] of the reclaimed , the product of the new forces at work , strolled despondently , carrying a rifle by its middle .	one
[MASK] had a uniform jacket with one button off , and seeing a white man on the path , hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity .	He
[MASK] was simple prudence , white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be .	This
After all , [MASK] also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings .	I
Instead of going up , [MASK] turned and descended to the left .	I
My [MASK] was to let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill .	idea
[MASK] know I am not particularly tender ;	You
[MASK] 've had to strike and to fend off . I 've had to resist and to attack sometimes – that 's only one way of resisting – without counting the exact cost , according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into .	I
[MASK] 've seen the devil of violence , and the devil of greed , and the devil of hot desire ; but , by all the stars ! these were strong , lusty , red-eyed devils , that swayed and drove men – men , I tell you .	I
But as I stood on this hillside , [MASK] foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby , pretending , weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly .	I
How insidious he could be , too , [MASK] was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther .	I
For a moment [MASK] stood appalled , as though by a warning .	I
Finally [MASK] descended the hill , obliquely , towards the trees I had seen .	I
[MASK] avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope , the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine .	I
[MASK] was n't a quarry or a sandpit , anyhow .	It
[MASK] was just a hole .	It
[MASK] do n't know .	I
Then [MASK] nearly fell into a very narrow ravine , almost no more than a scar in the hillside .	I
[MASK] discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there .	I
[MASK] was a wanton smash-up .	It
at last [MASK] got under the trees .	I
My [MASK] was to stroll into the shade for a moment ; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into a gloomy circle of some Inferno .	purpose
The [MASK] were near , and an uninterrupted , uniform , headlong , rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove , where not a breath stirred , not a leaf moved , with a mysterious sound – as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible .	rapids
Black [MASK] crouched , lay , sat between the trees , leaning against the trunks , clinging to the earth , half coming out , half effaced within the dim light , in all the attitudes of pain , abandonment , and despair .	shapes
[MASK] is waiting ! '	He
[MASK] did not see the real significance of that wreck at once .	I
Certainly the [MASK] was too stupid – when I think of it – to be altogether natural .	affair
Still ... . But at the moment [MASK] presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance .	it
[MASK] had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board , in charge of some volunteer skipper , and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones , and she sank near the south bank .	They
[MASK] asked myself what I was to do there , now my boat was lost .	I
As a matter of fact , [MASK] had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river .	I
[MASK] had to set about it the very next day .	I
[MASK] , and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station , took some months .	That
My first [MASK] with the manager was curious .	interview
[MASK] did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning .	He
[MASK] was commonplace in complexion , in features , in manners , and in voice .	He
[MASK] was of middle size and of ordinary build .	He
His [MASK] , of the usual blue , were perhaps remarkably cold , and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe .	eyes
But even at these times the [MASK] of his person seemed to disclaim the intention .	rest
[MASK] was unconscious , this smile was , though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant .	It
[MASK] came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable .	It
[MASK] was a common trader , from his youth up employed in these parts – nothing more .	He
[MASK] inspired uneasiness . That was it ! Uneasiness . Not a definite mistrust – just uneasiness – nothing more .	He
[MASK] have no idea how effective such a ... a ... faculty can be .	You
[MASK] had no genius for organizing , for initiative , or for order even .	He
[MASK] was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station .	That
[MASK] had no learning , and no intelligence .	He
His [MASK] had come to him – why ? Perhaps because he was never ill ...	position
[MASK] had served three terms of three years out there ... Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself .	He
When he went home on leave [MASK] rioted on a large scale – pompously . Jack ashore – with a difference – in externals only .	he
This [MASK] could gather from his casual talk .	one
[MASK] originated nothing , he could keep the routine going – that 's all . But he was great .	He
[MASK] was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man .	He
[MASK] never gave that secret away .	He
Such a [MASK] made one pause – for out there there were no external checks .	suspicion
' [MASK] sealed the utterance with that smile of his , as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping .	He
[MASK] fancied you had seen things – but the seal was on .	You
When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence , [MASK] ordered an immense round table to be made , for which a special house had to be built .	he
[MASK] was the station 's mess-room .	This
[MASK] felt this to be his unalterable conviction .	One
[MASK] was neither civil nor uncivil .	He
[MASK] was quiet .	He
[MASK] allowed his boy – an overfed young negro from the coast – to treat the white men , under his very eyes , with provoking insolence .	He
[MASK] began to speak as soon as he saw me .	He
[MASK] had been very long on the road .	I
[MASK] could not wait . Had to start without me .	He
[MASK] paid no attention to my explanations , and , playing with a stick of sealing-wax , repeated several times that the situation was ' very grave , very grave . '	He
Mr. [MASK] was ...	Kurtz
[MASK] felt weary and irritable . Hang Kurtz , I thought .	I
[MASK] interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the coast .	I
' Ah ! So [MASK] talk of him down there , he murmured to himself .	they
Then [MASK] began again , assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had , an exceptional man , of the greatest importance to the Company ; therefore I could understand his anxiety .	he
[MASK] was , he said , ' very , very uneasy . '	He
Certainly [MASK] fidgeted on his chair a good deal , exclaimed , ' Ah , Mr. Kurtz ! ' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident .	he
Next thing [MASK] wanted to know ' how long it would take to ' ...	he
[MASK] interrupted him again .	I
Being hungry , you know , and kept on my feet too , [MASK] was getting savage .	I
' How could I tell , [MASK] said . '	I
[MASK] had n't even seen the wreck yet – some months , no doubt .	I
All this [MASK] seemed to me so futile .	talk
Some months , [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] flung out of his hut ( he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda ) muttering to myself my opinion of him .	I
[MASK] was a chattering idiot .	He
Afterwards [MASK] took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the ' affair . '	I
[MASK] went to work the next day , turning , so to speak , my back on that station .	I
In that way only [MASK] seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life .	it
Still , [MASK] must look about sometimes ; and then I saw this station , these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard .	one
[MASK] asked myself sometimes what it all meant .	I
[MASK] wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands , like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence .	They
The word ' [MASK] ' rang in the air , was whispered , was sighed .	ivory
[MASK] would think they were praying to it .	You
A [MASK] of imbecile rapacity blew through it all , like a whiff from some corpse .	taint
By Jove ! [MASK] 've never seen anything so unreal in my life .	I
And outside , the silent [MASK] surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible , like evil or truth , waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion .	wilderness
Various [MASK] happened .	things
One evening a grass [MASK] full of calico , cotton prints , beads , and I do n't know what else , burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash .	shed
[MASK] was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer , and saw them all cutting capers in the light , with their arms lifted high , when the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river , a tin pail in his hand , assured me that everybody was ' behaving splendidly , splendidly , ' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again .	I
[MASK] noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail .	I
[MASK] strolled up .	I
You see the [MASK] had gone off like a box of matches .	thing
[MASK] had been hopeless from the very first . The flame had leaped high , driven everybody back , lighted up everything – and collapsed .	It
The [MASK] was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely .	shed
[MASK] said he had caused the fire in some way ; be that as it may , he was screeching most horribly .	They
[MASK] saw him , later on , for several days , sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself :	I
afterwards [MASK] arose and went out – and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again .	he
As I approached the glow from the dark [MASK] found myself at the back of two men , talking .	I
[MASK] heard the name of Kurtz pronounced , then the words , ' take advantage of this unfortunate accident . '	I
[MASK] of the men was the manager .	One
[MASK] wished him a good evening .	I
Did [MASK] ever see anything like it – eh ?	you
it is incredible , [MASK] said , and walked off .	he
The other [MASK] remained .	man
[MASK] was a first-class agent , young , gentlemanly , a bit reserved , with a forked little beard and a hooked nose .	He
[MASK] was stand-offish with the other agents , and they on their side said he was the manager 's spy upon them .	He
As to me , [MASK] had hardly ever spoken to him before .	I
[MASK] got into talk , and by-and-by we strolled away from the hissing ruins . Then he asked me to his room , which was in the main building of the station .	We
[MASK] struck a match , and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself .	He
Just at that time the [MASK] was the only man supposed to have any right to candles .	manager
Native [MASK] covered the clay walls ; a collection of spears , assegais , shields , knives was hung up in trophies .	mats
The [MASK] intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks – so I had been informed ; but there was n't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station , and he had been there more than a year – waiting .	business
However , [MASK] were all waiting – all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them – for something ; and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation , from the way they took it , though the only thing that ever came to them was disease – as far as I could see .	they
[MASK] was as unreal as everything else – as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern , as their talk , as their government , as their show of work .	It
The only real [MASK] was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had , so that they could earn percentages .	feeling
[MASK] intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account , – but as to effectually lifting a little finger – oh , no . By heavens !	They
Steal a horse straight out . Very well . [MASK] has done it . Perhaps he can ride .	He
From this standpoint , the [MASK] of the implementation of the budget may take on a dimension that overrides matters of detail .	evaluation
[MASK] of legality and regularity are increasing too .	Errors
The [MASK] will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .	vote
The main [MASK] of this agreement lies , I think , in its political nature .	importance
The [MASK] is extremely concerned at the latest developments in the Middle Eastern peace process .	Council
Otherwise [MASK] will find ourselves forced to take more serious decisions as regards our trading relations with Israel .	we
British [MASK] also believe that the Commission is wrong to bring forward this proposal in the name of the European Single Market .	Conservatives

The European [MASK] is not a military organization .	Union
The European Union 's economic [MASK] in Hong-Kong are both large in scale and deep-rooted .	interests
[MASK] assure the House firmly that Hong-Kong will not slip from our sights in the Commission .	I
An unsuccessful [MASK] will equally damage us all .	transition
[MASK] also want to express my disagreement on the support given to the American law on Hong-Kong .	I
[MASK] is the line taken in the reports before you today .	That

[MASK] is precisely when engines are claimed to be environment-friendly because they consume less fuel that we can not make any exceptions .	It
[MASK] needs greater definition on the issue of what is to be done at Community level in terms of employment policy .	It

Naturally , the Turkish [MASK] will have a place in the representation of the lawful and internationally recognized government of Cyprus .	Cypriots
How long will the transitional [MASK] be following Polish accession in the case of the free movement of persons ?	period
This [MASK] guarantees that all countries applying for membership are treated equally .	procedure
[MASK] would remind you that the negotiations with Spain and Portugal lasted seven years .	I
[MASK] appears to be the case with the events which Mr Lomas reports in his question .	This
Do [MASK] not think some of them , not all , are getting too big for their boots .	you
[MASK] will also give us a future in the two very important industries that we can not ignore and ensure Europe 's future prosperity .	It
[MASK] have done considerable research before coming to the conclusions before us tonight .	We
Secondly , in any case , [MASK] have to refurbish and invest in their refineries continuously .	they
The [MASK] is asking for a threshold of 50 to 30 ppm , which would also involve excessive cost without appreciable benefit .	rapporteur
But two [MASK] are in confrontation .	groups
[MASK] look forward to what the Commission has to say but I would sound a note of warning .	We

The [MASK] contains a number of proposals for tax concessions which many other speakers have mentioned in this evening 's debate .	report
For that reason the [MASK] believes that it is still too early to fix limit values for fuel quality for the year 2005 .	Commission

in order to bring immediate results [MASK] will also be necessary to have constant monitoring of the implementation of the directive .	it
The [MASK] caused by the absence of transparency are particularly severe .	problems
As a final point [MASK] emphasize that the existing positive actions must be kept in place .	I

Why do [MASK] raise the matter ?	I
[MASK] give the floor to Mrs Green .	I

Mr President , my [MASK] also concerns agriculture , bee-keeping to be precise .	report
[MASK] take their right to petition seriously .	Citizens
Sadly my [MASK] is not all plaudits .	report
[MASK] wonder whether they are in the debate this evening .	I
In that case , the [MASK] turns out to be a national problem after all .	matter
[MASK] is possible when the matter is raised with the Committee on Petitions .	It
So [MASK] is essential that we activate this right fully .	it
[MASK] won a case against the Greek railways several years ago and he is owed several thousand pounds by them .	He
[MASK] have shown that the future of the audio-visual industry is a debate which crosses all political and national boundaries .	We
[MASK] must be able to create and see our own stories , be it Inspector Morse or Derrick .	We
[MASK] can not accept that situation . The first reading provided a remedy .	We
Thanks to all this [MASK] will now be more difficult for public and private broadcasters to ignore the rules contained in the directive .	it
For European citizens , [MASK] ensures that the public interest is taken into consideration , which is so important to their daily lives .	it
Our fellow citizens ' [MASK] and nights are becoming increasingly noisy .	days
Two months ago [MASK] had to have an operation for a serious complaint .	I
No doubt [MASK] of what our citizens experience as noise does not fall within the competence of the Union .	much
And [MASK] is one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation that we have in Europe .	this

[MASK] would remind you that Mr Cornelissen 's report has been added to the agenda for Tuesday .	I
[MASK] hope she will take note of this , because it is an important point .	I

The next [MASK] is the joint debate on the following statement and oral question :	item
For this reason , the [MASK] of the Commission is worthy of our congratulations .	initiative
My [MASK] , the Liberal group , is presently focusing its attention on non-European Union nationals .	group
Madam President , [MASK] would also like to thank Mrs Bonino wholeheartedly for her work on behalf of the women in Kabul .	I
[MASK] fully support the need for contacts with third countries .	I
Secondly , [MASK] should not allow this to be postponed indefinitely , and we should not introduce provisions restricted to physical persons .	we
But [MASK] is not the language used in everyday encounters with the bemused populations of the EU countries .	that
Two [MASK] are becoming clear , one of which is a pragmatic approach .	approaches
Have [MASK] really begun ?	negotiations
Today [MASK] have two directives before us , including this one on capital income .	we
[MASK] believe this is a job for the final compromise round of Europe 's finance ministers .	I
Where coordinating tax policy is concerned , the main [MASK] is to limit manoeuvring and distortions on the capital markets .	objective
My [MASK] is one of them .	country
Your [MASK] said earlier – we only finished the debate barely twenty minutes ago – that this report would be voted on tomorrow .	predecessor
Now [MASK] come to the references to Macao .	we
In the motion for a resolution , [MASK] have :	we
The [MASK] China develops is vital for the way our own societies develop .	way
[MASK] will influence not only our economies but also , and above all , prospects for democracy world-wide .	It
Directive [MASK] established the principle that commercial road vehicles must undergo an annual roadworthiness test at an approved testing centre .	96/96/EC
However , [MASK] seriously doubt that the introduction of free market principles , which the report so enthusiastically recommends , is the right solution .	I
[MASK] would not be a good thing to blindly apply competition rules and risk endangering the efficiency of Community and national interventions .	It
In addition , the [MASK] has exclusive competence in matters of state aid .	Commission
In its communication , the [MASK] has presented some proposals for greater consistency between regional policy and competition policy in the EU .	Commission
This [MASK] must not become entrenched in a national-level mentality .	solution
The [MASK] has already established a number of actions to help them .	Commission
[MASK] concentrates on combating unemployment and ensuring that everyone has a job .	It
[MASK] must accept that .	We
The problem is that in many EU Member States [MASK] has become the easy option with dire consequences for the environment .	it
[MASK] reserve my right to come back on this when it goes back to committee .	I
On the question of whether to exempt energy-intensive industries , in our view the Commission 's [MASK] has advantages and disadvantages .	proposal
As a result , the [MASK] is complex , hard to understand and difficult to apply .	legislation
If I have a criticism of the Legal Affairs Committee 's opinion , it is that [MASK] is too one-sided .	it
[MASK] salute him for all he has done in this area .	I
Broad [MASK] of the population having access to these new forms of knowledge and learning is something we should very much welcome .	sections
[MASK] is a directive which safeguards the interests of rightholders and protects intellectual property .	It
[MASK] is why the Socialist Group will be supporting this position .	That
The [MASK] concerns the limitations on copyright , in which context we have logically proposed providing compensation .	first
Cultural [MASK] do exist , and so I do not understand why there should not be mandatory provision for exemptions .	differences
Some time ago [MASK] debated about giving the rights to artists who sell their artwork .	we
[MASK] is a right which does not incur financial consequences .	This
Blank [MASK] will not enrich our society .	screens

The [MASK] is now in the Commission 's court .	ball
At one time , almost all Europe 's major [MASK] came into being with the help of a producer who believed in them .	hits
[MASK] feel that the Internet provides an effective way of avoiding that stranglehold .	We
The information [MASK] is in fact evolving in a global context .	society
[MASK] am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament 's work .	I
[MASK] can not , however , accept the concept of ' economic significance ' for the rightholder .	We
Your [MASK] uphold two important principles : the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies .	amendments
The first [MASK] protects a need for equity ; it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector .	principle
[MASK] is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States .	That
The very [MASK] of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product .	structure
Mr President , [MASK] should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to Mr Martin .	I
The [MASK] , Commissioner Fischler , was also not nearly as good as this one .	proposal
[MASK] have changed in some respects , while in others they have remained the same .	Circumstances
[MASK] is why we support the Agriculture Committee 's call for a framework regulation .	That
Each [MASK] has its own way of making wine .	area
[MASK] will only counter overproduction by introducing comprehensive new quality criteria .	We
[MASK] support Mr Martin 's report and we say one thing : quality not quantity !	We
Contrary to the Commission proposals , [MASK] must preserve the current procedure known as the Article 43 procedure .	we
[MASK] is the information I have on this type of activity .	That
[MASK] have the floor , Mr Van Miert .	You
Mr President , there has been considerable [MASK] made with regard to the internal market for medicinal products .	progress
[MASK] should just like to confirm that the Commissioner and the French Minister for Europe are both agreed on that point .	I
[MASK] was obviously anxious to hear the speech in full ,	I
In any case , [MASK] congratulate Mrs Thors on her French ; I certainly can not speak in Swedish or Finnish .	I
Once again , [MASK] is a question of habit .	it
[MASK] also applies to charges on cross-border transfers .	This
[MASK] have done so : on 5 February we published an extremely detailed press release dealing with the questions you have raised .	We
[MASK] will bear in mind however , as these debates are of especial interest to me , that Spain has been particularly affected .	I
Mr [MASK] now has the floor for one minute , and his will be the last question to Mr van den Broek today .	Hatzidakis
As regards the negotiations , [MASK] know the Commission 's position .	you
[MASK] must confess I am totally surprised that the Commission was not aware of this report , given its sensitivity at this particular time .	I
So [MASK] do not have a supplementary question , I just want to register my protest .	I
[MASK] has always failed to deal with the real issue , namely the closing-down of Sellafield .	It
[MASK] have sat here patiently and I find it quite extraordinary that you are not calling me .	I
Instead of that , [MASK] called Mr Fitzsimons as a supplementary to Mr Smith .	you
[MASK] have the impression that the honourable Member believes the public invitation to tender in connection with the tunnel has already started .	I
[MASK] also think that the Commission 's proposals are better able to provide this guarantee of dynamic equilibrium .	I
[MASK] also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission .	This
[MASK] can see that the draft CAP reforms tend to become embedded in the rut defined by the Commission 's too liberal tendencies .	Everyone
The [MASK] on Agriculture and Rural Development is very attentive to the demands of the experts and of society .	Committee
[MASK] is why we will be approving the report which has been presented to us .	This
[MASK] hope that the debate on wine-growing will benefit the wine producer , the product and the consumer alike .	I
[MASK] are always talking about quality ; well , I believe that quality also means giving priority to products wholly derived from the vine .	We
Unfortunately , with respect , [MASK] shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to .	it
Ladies and gentlemen from both North and South , [MASK] must vote in favour of this report .	we
Commissioner [MASK] should know this .	Brittan
The appropriate [MASK] for the settlement of this dispute is the World Trade Organisation .	forum
[MASK] therefore urge the German presidency to take whatever initiative is necessary in the Bonn EU/US summit in June .	I
[MASK] is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him .	It
[MASK] shall not only condemn them .	We

[MASK] can now give the floor to one speaker in favour and one against .	I
A pirate electronic [MASK] is available but not in French .	version
In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy , the [MASK] of the Community needs to undergo radical reform .	financing
President [MASK] rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000 .	Santer
[MASK] can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council .	You
At the same time that one truly European own [MASK] is waning rapidly in its importance .	resource
Yet , the good old traditional own [MASK] are the cause of major headaches for control and concern about fraud .	resources
[MASK] have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency .	We
[MASK] makes life very difficult for Members , Commissioners and the press .	It
Mr President , [MASK] should also like to compliment Mrs Haug on her report .	I
[MASK] are very fundamental points for the future .	These
[MASK] is a question of appropriateness and of review .	It
Only one [MASK] can protect us from this unfortunate fate and that is the rule of unanimity .	thing
[MASK] should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Valverde 's question .	I
The [MASK] you visited do not belong to the European Commission and the staff you met are not employed by the European Commission .	premises
[MASK] am unaware of the reasons behind this situation you describe though I can make an educated guess at them .	I
Could [MASK] please explain it more clearly ?	you
[MASK] would like to make that crystal-clear .	I
[MASK] am referring to the Rio Coco project .	I
[MASK] am grateful to the honourable Member for his question .	I
[MASK] just hope that I will be invited to the opening ceremony because we worked damned hard to get it .	I
European [MASK] rose during that period but the situation has now been rectified .	exports
The only [MASK] of any significance is canned tomatoes , but even they account for no more than 7 -% of the market .	product
For my part , [MASK] feel that the negotiations were balanced and that they open the way for achieving a sustainable market .	I
[MASK] know yourself that the agreement with South Africa was held up because of the fisheries question , too .	You
[MASK] have to take more into account the whole question of , not just giving aid , but fair trade .	You
The overall [MASK] was 6500 tonnes of canned tomatoes .	amount
[MASK] shall be discussing the new trends in consumption and trafficking and the prospects for the future .	We
[MASK] know for certain that those who try to reach the coast of Europe by sea from Morocco often meet a grim fate .	We
[MASK] know that there are boats plying between Morocco and Spain and Gibraltar , and that the different authorities concerned are cooperating fully .	We
What do [MASK] think are the target routes here ?	you
Question [MASK] will therefore receive a written answer .	No-49
[MASK] are closely monitoring the matter and should know whether the regime has been modified within the next few weeks .	We
Detailed [MASK] on EU trade with Cuba are not available .	statistics
[MASK] understand from sources in the Scottish industry that there is a major company involved in Norway at the moment .	I
As I have said , 84 [MASK] have had the undertakings replaced by duties instead .	exporters
[MASK] has led to the adoption of a common position on Burma and the withdrawal of GSP benefits .	This
In this case [MASK] are talking about the market for processed meat products .	we
[MASK] had therefore been hoping for a common sense reply , Commissioner , not a technical one .	I
The [MASK] is more modest .	directive
[MASK] Nos 60 to 111 will therefore receive written answers .	Questions
[MASK] concludes Question Time .	That
[MASK] aims at the heart of the matter , as Agenda 2000 negotiations have reached a critical stage .	It
The [MASK] is the financing of EU enlargement .	issue
[MASK] are now fighting over who is going to pay for it .	We
[MASK] speak on behalf of the British Labour Members on that major area of dissent .	I
At the moment , [MASK] has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union , something like 25 billion .	Germany
Firstly , does the total [MASK] of Community budget receipts cover the current requirement of the European Union ?	amount
How much further do [MASK] want it to fall ?	you
[MASK] therefore had to meet these two fundamental objectives and I sincerely believe that we are close to achieving this .	We
[MASK] merely refer to purely linguistic and formal aspects .	Some
[MASK] transport politicians always try to be precise , without letting things get out of hand .	We
During the conciliation procedure the [MASK] , indeed you , Commissioner , declared that a proposal on seaports would be on the table immediately .	Commission
[MASK] have worked on the networks too long for this to happen .	We
That is what [MASK] want to talk about today .	I
[MASK] admit that , Commissioner , and also thank the Commission for improving its proposal compared to the original text .	I
[MASK] need a brief report summarising the experience gained and a clear review .	We
[MASK] makes sense because the viability of infrastructure investments obviously depends on competitive revenue-raising services and competitive services clearly need quality infrastructure .	That
Amendment [MASK] makes more radical changes to the guideline maps , adding new links and creating new categories of ports .	No-6
[MASK] I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House .	All
[MASK] , however , is not the proposal before the House .	This
That [MASK] always gets , whether he likes it or not .	he
[MASK] is up to the railway undertakings to decide whether to do so more in the form of cooperation or of competition .	It
[MASK] believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases .	I
Each [MASK] should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction .	country
Personally , [MASK] should like to see a number of other requirements deleted .	I
Consequently , the [MASK] could , in practice , produce the opposite effect to that intended and become an obstacle to increased competition .	proposals
But the [MASK] for the renaissance of the railways is at hand , and that is what we should strive for .	opportunity
Compared with my own objectives , [MASK] do not think the demands made by either of them are tough enough .	I
Mr President , here too [MASK] must congratulate the two rapporteurs .	I
[MASK] do not agree with him at all .	I
How can [MASK] license individual operators if we do not make that separation ?	we
Why do [MASK] say that ?	we
[MASK] all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years .	We
My [MASK] welcomes that opportunity and supports the Commission and our rapporteurs in their efforts to secure a future for Europe 's railways .	group
Both the [MASK] before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road .	reports
If rail is to have real vitality , then [MASK] is going to have to change .	rail
[MASK] results in a less clear definition and is , in our view , an unnecessary change .	It
[MASK] have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over-prescriptive .	I
[MASK] will encourage them to place greater reliance on this mode of transport .	It
[MASK] have to make a stronger commitment to rail .	They
[MASK] conclude by thanking both rapporteurs ,	I
[MASK] hope that the whole House will endorse their constructive approach .	I
[MASK] will meet that commitment .	We
The [MASK] will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .	vote
A [MASK] cried out on the roof , and he woke up .	bird
[MASK] was the middle of the afternoon , in the heat , in Africa ;	It
[MASK] knew at once where he was .	he

A few days ago [MASK] was in that house , packing to leave in the flat progression of practical matters by which decision is broken up into reality .	he
But your waist [MASK] has n't changed by so much as half an inch ...	measurement
[MASK] know by your pyjama trousers , I use exactly the same measurement for new elastic as I always did .	I
Three months before , [MASK] Mweta stood outside a steak house in Kensington and said to him ,	Adamson
Of course [MASK] 'll come back to us now !	you
[MASK] had driven home , slowing down on the empty road that led through the fullness of a deserted summer twilight , at last , to the house .	He
Housing [MASK] overrun villages all over England , but here the process had been reversed ; the house had once been a manor ( Olivia thought that , even earlier , it had been a priory ) but in the nineteenth century the village was depopulated by the drift to industrialized towns , lost its autonomy , and died ; the shop-cum-post-office had closed , the cottages had fallen down ;	estates
As Olivia said , [MASK] ought to have been a sad-feeling place but it was n't ; there was instead a renewal : the country had come back , bringing the reassurance of stubborn peace and fecundity , a beginning again .	it
And [MASK] were only two-hours-and-a-bit from London , their daughters and their friends .	they
[MASK] had kept up , since he finally left Africa ten years ago , a close contact with Adamson Mweta and the other leaders of the African independence movement .	He
[MASK] spent a great deal of time going back and forth to London to advise them when they conferred with the Colonial Office , and to do what he could to smooth the way for various delegations that came to petition against the old constitution and to negotiate independence for their country .	He
[MASK] said to his wife , Mweta 's invited me to come back as their guest .	He
Well , [MASK] ought to be at the Independence celebrations , if anyone is .	you
[MASK] 's marvellous .	That
[MASK] used to make packages of sandwiches for Mweta to take with him when he cycled for miles about Gala province at weekends , speaking at meetings .	She
[MASK] said to Adamson Mweta before they parted the next day , Olivia wo n't be able to come out to Independence , unfortunately ... our elder daughter 's expecting a child just round about that time .	He
[MASK] said , with his slow shy smile that always seemed to grow like a light becoming more powerful , as his eyes held you , You mean little Venetia ?	Mweta
[MASK] going to be a mother ?	She
I 'm afraid so , [MASK] mumbled in his Englishman 's way .	he
Well , [MASK] 's good , that 's good .	that
Never mind , Mrs. [MASK] will join you later .	Bray
[MASK] imagine by the time she 's prepared to trust the baby to Venetia the celebrations 'll be over .	I
That 's what [MASK] mean –	I
[MASK] were standing at the door of Mweta 's taxi ; there was a sudden uprush of feeling between the two men ; the Englishman stood there , the small , quick black man took him by the biceps , hard , through his dark suit , as in his own country he would have linked fingers with a brother .	They
Under the release of physical contact , [MASK] said to Mweta , I do n't know what we 're talking about , and Mweta said , You ... I told you we expect you back , now .	he
But what would [MASK] do ?	I
[MASK] was so accustomed to effacing himself in the hours of discussion of constitutional law and political tactics ( a white man , an outsider offering impersonal service for whatever it was worth ) ...	He
Whatever [MASK] like !	you
[MASK] 's all ours !	It
[MASK] need you ; whatever you like !	We
[MASK] broke away and jumped into the taxi .	Mweta
The pale stone [MASK] with its stone lintels and sills worn smooth as a piece of used soap was directly on the empty road but the real face of the house was the other side .	façade
Sheltered by the building the [MASK] was a grassy look-out over fuzzy colours of flowers , bees , and early moths to the long valley .	garden
[MASK] and Olivia gardened on summer evenings , not seriously , as she did during the day , but desultorily pulling out a tall rank weed here or there , for the pleasure of feeling its roots yield from the humus and bring up , in the crumbs clinging to that beard grown underground , a smell of earth rich as fruit-cake .	He
[MASK] had laid flag-stones under the walnut trees for the white wooden chairs and table , so that it would n't be too damp .	They
[MASK] drank whisky there , or even the coffee after dinner .	They
Sometimes before the dusk wavered the wood away into the distance , [MASK] went out into the sunlight that collected like golden water in the dip of the meadows and shot a partridge .	he
Afterwards as the evening faded [MASK] cleaned the gun almost by feel and the clean , practical smell of gun-oil conveyed the simple satisfaction of the task .	he
[MASK] played records with the living-room windows wide open so that the music came out to them .	Olivia
This summer [MASK] was Stravinsky and Poulenc ;	it
[MASK] was of the generation and class that paid other women to knit and now that she herself was about to be a grandmother she made funny stuffed toys for nieces and nephews .	she
[MASK] had a cigar box full of odd buttons , as a supply of eyes , but she put it away from her because one of the things she had hated when she was young was the show of dissembling older women made when confronted with something vital to them .	She
[MASK] suppose we said many times we 'd come back when they got their independence .	I
[MASK] gave a small , self-questioning shrug , admitting the glibness of another kind of daily talk in another time .	She
[MASK] 's not because of what one said .	It
But [MASK] knew that , in those days , the important thing was to give Adamson Mweta faith in himself by positing a future that was real because you , a white person with nothing personal to gain by it , showed you believed it would come about .	both
Gazing out across the valley and then calmly at him , [MASK] had her look of wanting to find out exactly what they were talking about .	she
[MASK] said , Certainly I thought of going back , then . Before we left .	He
Just as [MASK] knew we should have to leave .	I
Poor Adamson , [MASK] looked pretty hopeless at times .	it
And yet [MASK] 's come so quickly .	it
Historically , yes , [MASK] would happen but not to Adamson , and not to us ?	it
The [MASK] they had bought , filled with possessions that had been stored all the years they were in Africa , the garden they had made , spoke for them .	house
[MASK] was not a house to be quitted .	It
They expect you back , [MASK] said with pride .	she
[MASK] was in the flush of victory , all right .	Adamson
[MASK] think he 'd have embraced Henry Davis .	I
[MASK] was the settler M.P. who had been responsible , at one stage , for getting Mweta banished to the far Western Province .	Davis
[MASK] naturally assumes you 'll come out of exile .	He
[MASK] laughed .	They
But [MASK] were talking of Mweta ;	they
the strange [MASK] of twenty-two years of marriage made it impossible for her to say : Do you want to go ?	shyness
And in a way [MASK] did know : because it was for them a code so deeply accepted that it had never been discussed ...	she
[MASK] was available wherever one was of use .	one
What [MASK] was there to live by ?	else
And so the [MASK] of what they were talking about really amounted to her hidden , pressed-down , banked-over desire to know whether this house , this life in Wiltshire , this life – at last – seemed to him the definitive one , in the end .	question
Because [MASK] was suddenly realizing that it had been so for her .	she
[MASK] was , after all ( in the true sense of after all that had gone before ) an Englishwoman .	She
[MASK] had taken out of storage the furniture and family possessions that had been nothing but a nuisance to her when they left England together twenty years ago , and , putting them in place , inevitably had accepted the life the arrangement of such objects provided for , and her comfortable private income made possible .	She
In the room they had decided upon for his study , the [MASK] from her great-grandfather that had naturally become his – a quiet field of black-red morocco scratched with almost erased gold – was a place to write the properly documented history of the territory ( Mweta 's country ) that had never been done before ; not the boxwood Colonial Office desk at which one dealt with government forms and made the empirical scribbles of administration or politics .	desk
In the scented , mothy evening [MASK] felt the presence of the house like someone standing behind her .	she
[MASK] did not know whether he felt it too ; and she could not try to find out because if it turned out that he did n't – she had a premonition , sometimes , that in middle age you could find you had lost everything in a moment : husband – lover , friend , children , it was as if they had never happened , or you had wandered off from them without knowing , and now stood stock-still with the discovery .	She
[MASK] watched the moths in the tobacco flowers .	They
[MASK] said in her sensible , inquiring , Englishwoman 's voice behind which generations of her kind had sheltered , Did Mweta say how long ?	She
[MASK] was very much a gesture !	It
No , but [MASK] 'd already mentioned it yesterday , is n't that so ?	he
[MASK] misunderstood him yesterday .	You
Good Lord , [MASK] 've no idea , I 'm sure he has n't either .	I
[MASK] 's all in the air .	It
[MASK] went in to change the record and because it was , unexpectedly , Mozart – the harp and Mute concerto – he lit a cigar to smoke while he enjoyed it .	Olivia
[MASK] wandered down to the herb garden and brought back a branch of dill ;	She
There he is , [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] remarked that tomorrow she must pick the dill for drying .	She
Everything was just as [MASK] was .	it
But [MASK] was changed .	everything
[MASK] had turned over in the barrel of the world and steadied itself again .	All
[MASK] knew , if he did n't , that he was going .	She
[MASK] hauled down his coat again to get out at Athens .	He
The metal [MASK] of the steps wheeled against the plane was icy-wet to his palm and in the streaming rain he did not smell the Aegean or thyme , as he had remembered from other journeys to Africa .	rail
Inside the airport under the yellow light the [MASK] sat down again on exhausted-looking chairs , bundled deep in their heavy clothing .	passengers
An old [MASK] with crinkly grey hair woke up at her post outside the lavatory and opened the door , smiling and grasping a filthy cleaning rag .	woman
[MASK] walked around to ease the cramp in his knees but there was a small circumference and within a few strides one found oneself back again at the shop , before which women and child passengers were drawn to gaze at embroidered aprons and evzone dolls .	He
A [MASK] of ten or eleven with the badges of the cantons of Switzerland sewn to the sleeve of her coat had exactly the look of Venetia at that age .	girl
[MASK] bought a postcard of brilliant blue sea and dazzling white ruins and tried to write , in what he could remember of Greek :	He
My [MASK] to you , James .	love
[MASK] had had a first in Greek , herself , only a year ago , and could laugh over the mistakes .	Venetia
But [MASK] was the end of Europe .	that
At Kano a huge [MASK] shone and in a light brighter than a European winter afternoon the passengers made their way across the tarmac at three in the morning against the resistance of a heat of the day persisting all through the night as the sun persists in a stone it has warmed .	moon
the [MASK] moving about beneath the belly of the plane had bare black feet .	men
When the passengers climbed aboard again , their [MASK] felt hairy and the plane was airless .	clothes
[MASK] put the coat away on the rack , apologizing , trying not to hamper other people in the general move to rearrange gear ; the anticipation of arrival , still some hours off , aroused in them not so much common purpose as a spread of instinct as in the lifted heads of a herd become aware of the promise of water .	He
When the sun rose [MASK] slumped off into sleep , but women began to examine the plastic bags in which they kept their hats , and , as the hard beams of the sun struck into the cabin on hairnets , pale lips , and stubble , queues formed for the lavatories .	some
While he was writing on the customs and immigration form , BRAY , Evelyn James , and the number of his passport , [MASK] was reading his name over his shoulder ; he flexed it awkwardly , not because he minded , but in mild embarrassment .	someone
The [MASK] for the lavatory moved along a notch , he glanced up and the man , carrying a flowered sponge-bag , caught his eye with a tired vacant stare that changed to an expression of greeting .	queue
The [MASK] who had dozed beside him all night communicating the intimate rhythm of her breathing but never exchanging a word , suddenly began to talk like a bird who has the cover taken off its cage .	woman
[MASK] wedged himself between the seats to recover the shoe she had lost somewhere over a distant desert ;	He
[MASK] laughed , protested apologetically , and shook cologne down into her freckled bosom .	she
Dragging back the little curtain from the oval window , [MASK] looked into the dazzling glare of space and said , Glorious morning up here ! and they discussed with animation the cold and sudden winter that was left behind .	she
As he did not have a window seat [MASK] did not see the bush and the earth red as brick-dust and the furze of growth along the river-beds :	he
not until the [MASK] had come to a stop on the runway , and they were waiting for the health inspector to come aboard .	plane
[MASK] unhooked his safety belt and leaned over to look at an angle through the bleary lens on the far side of the aisle ; and there it was , tiny and distorted and real , bush , earth , exactly as it remained in his mind always , without his thinking about it .	He
[MASK] was underfoot .	It
[MASK] was around .	It
A black [MASK] in khaki shorts ( used to be a white man in white stockings ) sprayed a cloyingly perfumed insecticide over the passengers ' heads as a precaution against the plane harbouring mosquitoes and tsetse flies .	man
The [MASK] opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged among the others into heady recognition taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac through the raw-potato whiff of the undergrowth , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat ,	doors
The disembarking [MASK] were all strangers again , connected not with each other but to the mouthing , smiling faces and waving hands on the airport balcony .	passengers
[MASK] knew no one but the walk was processional , a reception to him , and by the time he entered the building over the steps where , as always , dead insects fallen from the light during the night had not been swept away , it was all as suddenly familiar and ordinary as the faces other people were greeting were , to them .	He
Waiting to be summoned to the customs officers ' booths , the [MASK] of the journey ignored each other .	companions
Only the [MASK] with the flowered sponge-bag , as if unaware of this useful convention , insisted on a Here we are again smile .	man
[MASK] 're Colonel Bray ?	You
[MASK] spoke round the obstacle of a woman standing between them .	He
[MASK] must confess I do n't remember you .	I
[MASK] 've been away a long time .	I
The [MASK] had long coarse strands of sun-yellowed hair spread from ear to ear across a bald head and wore sunglasses that rested on fine Nordic cheekbones .	man
[MASK] 've only just come to live here ... from down South . South Africa .	I
Who was that [MASK] do n't know ... one of the people from the plane ... a baldish fair man with an accent , I did n't catch the name .	I
[MASK] 'd recently moved up here .	He
Oh [MASK] Wentz must have been .	Hjalmar
[MASK] and his wife took over the Silver Rhino last year .	He
[MASK] like old Hjalmar .	I
[MASK] 's just been to Denmark or somewhere because his mother died .	He
[MASK] 'll go in and have a steak there one evening , they 're trying to make a go of it with a charcoal grill and whatnot .	We
[MASK] happened to McGowan ?	What
[MASK] 's got the character of the miners ' pub it was , but it 's very handy for the new government offices , not too overawing , so you get quite a few Africans coming in .	it
A genteel lot , very conscious of their dignity , man-about-town and all that , [MASK] can imagine how the white toughies feel about all those white collars round black necks in the bar .	you
[MASK] 's as gentle as a lamb and he has to keep the peace somehow .	Hjalmar
Oh [MASK] 'll tell you who 's still around though – Barry Forsyth .	I
Forsyth Construction . [MASK] 'll see the board everywhere .	You
[MASK] tell me he 's got the contract for the whole Isoza River reclamation scheme ... employs engineers from Poland and Italy	They
Because of the mosquitoes , [MASK] moved into the house .	they
The [MASK] came out from behind the pictures and flattened like starfish against the walls .	spiders
Of course [MASK] do n't open wrong kind bottle .	I
[MASK] know when is eat-e chicken , I know when is eat-e beef .	I
Well [MASK] is the wrong one , because I told you this morning I wanted the round flat bottle put in the fridge .	it
[MASK] say I cook chicken , is n't it ?	You
[MASK] look , I see the round bottle is red wine inside ...	I
[MASK] 's pink .	It
[MASK] specially did n't say anything about the colour because I did n't want to muddle you up .	I
[MASK] know how obstinate you are , Festus ...	I
[MASK] argued self-righteously as two old-maid sisters .	They
[MASK] , equally assured , went on talking as if without interruption .	Dando
[MASK] have n't replaced the District Commissioner by appointing a district magistrate .	You
[MASK] 've only replaced one of his functions .	You
[MASK] 've still got to get country people to realize that these functions are now distributed among various agencies :	You
But now [MASK] have to learn that there 's a Department of Public Health to go to .	people
[MASK] and resentment hand in hand .	Dependency
Whatever the black magistrates are like , whatever the administration 's like , [MASK] wo n't be like that .	it
The [MASK] are all right , do n't you worry .	magistrates
The [MASK] does n't change of course .	Bench
[MASK] laughed at Dando 's expression ;	Bray
They 'll die off , [MASK] suppose .	I
But [MASK] knows what we 'll get then .	God
[MASK] met Gwenzi 's brother in London one day while he was at Gray 's Inn ;	I
[MASK] told me he was going to be the first African at the bar here .	he
When Dando 's opinion of someone was really low [MASK] did not seem to hear his name .	he
Do n't think I do n't know I 've got some bad times coming to me , [MASK] said , as if taking up , in private , current talk about himself .	he
When I said yes to Mweta [MASK] knew it and every time I walk past the title on my office door I know it .	I
The [MASK] will come when I 'll have deportation orders to sign that I wo n't want to sign .	day
[MASK] ate a mouthful of the left-over granadilla pudding , and there was the smallest tremor , passing for a moment through his head .	He
And [MASK] 'll be instructing the State Prosecutor to act when I 'd rather not , too .	I
That [MASK] can count on .	I
Well , [MASK] know .	I
But why on earth should [MASK] come to that ?	it
[MASK] knew it when I said yes to Mweta .	I
The blacks ' dirty [MASK] is n't any cleaner than the whites ' .	work
[MASK] 's what they 'll be happy to note .	That
But what their contented little minds will never know is that [MASK] knew it when I took the job , I knew it all along , and I 'll say it now as loud as I 'd say it then ...	I
[MASK] 'll be happy ?	Who
[MASK] refilled the brandy glasses again .	Dando
[MASK] went to the kitchen to fill his brandy glass with water for the night .	Bray
[MASK] fled , pausing , from what they regarded as positions of safety , to twirl their antennae .	Cockroaches
A furry black [MASK] of ants led up a cupboard door to some scrap that had flicked from a plate .	band
[MASK] stood at the sink , drinking cold water and looking at the avocado pear pip growing suspended by three matchsticks in the neck of a pickle jar of water on the sill .	He
[MASK] was conscious of a giddy swing of weight from one foot to the other that was not of his volition ; it seemed he had been standing there a long time – he was not sure .	He
[MASK] heard Dando , forced by the old Labrador into the garden , walking about outside the guest hut and talking reproachfully to the dog ;	He
and then [MASK] was morning and Festus 's assistant was at the door with the early tea .	it
A [MASK] snored over the celebrations , drowning the exchange of greetings when Bray was introduced to someone in the street , expunging conversation in bars and even speeches .	helicopter
[MASK] knew what it was for ... a security measure , some were satisfied to assume , while others accepted it as vaguely appropriate , the symbol of progress inseparable from all industrial fairs and agricultural shows and therefore somehow relevant to any public display .	Nobody
[MASK] Bayley was the one to find this out , because of some domestic mishap or misunderstanding that made his arrival at the visitors ' stand very late .	Neil
[MASK] was conscious of furious tension between the young couple at his side as he sat with the great stir of tiers of people behind , and the space in front of him , before the velvet-draped and canopied dais , filled with press photographers and radio and television crews , who all through the solemnities raced about bent double on frantic tiptoe , snaking their wires , thrusting up their contraptions manipulating shutters and flashlights .	Bray
This [MASK] and the risen temper along the back of a silent quarrel beside him provided the strong distraction of another , disorderly level of being that always seemed to him to take away from planned great moments what they were meant to hold heady and pure .	activity
[MASK] had the mummified look of one who has become a vessel of ritual .	Mweta
But once the declaration of independence was pronounced [MASK] came , as out of a trance , to an irresistibly lively self , sitting up there seeing everything around him , a spectator , Bray felt , as well as a spectacle .	he
[MASK] talked to the elderly English princess who sat beside him with her knees peaked neatly together in the Royal position curiously expressive of the suffering of ceremonies , and Bray saw him point out the contingent of Gala women , their faces and breasts whitened for joy , who were lined up among the troops of musicians and dancers from various regions .	He
And yet when that ceremony was over , and in between all the other official occasions – State Ball , receptions , cocktail parties , banquets , and luncheons – a [MASK] of celebration grew up , as it were , outside the palace gates .	mood
[MASK] attended most of the official occasions ( he and Roly saluted each other with mock surprise when they met in the house , half-dressed in formal dinner clothes every night ) but the real parties took place before and after .	He
[MASK] grew spontaneously one out of the other , and once you had been present at the first , you got handed on to all the others .	These
[MASK] really knew only some of the people but all of them seemed to know about him , and many were the friends of friends .	He
[MASK] took him to the Bayleys ; but Neil was a friend of Mweta , and Vivien was the niece of , of all people , Sir William Clough , the last governor , who had been a junior with Bray in the colonial service in Tanganyika .	Dando
The [MASK] were friends of Cyprian Kente , Mweta 's Minister of the Interior , and his wife Tindi , and Timothy Odara , one of the territory 's few African doctors , whom Bray , of course , knew well .	Bayleys
Through each individual the [MASK] extended to someone else and drew in , out of the new international character of the little capital , Poles , Ghanaians , Hungarians and Israelis , South African and Rhodesian refugees .	group
[MASK] Dando had promised to drop by , and of course Bray was with him .	Roly
[MASK] went up from the people already present who had not been at the ball ; they had decided to dress for once , too , and the two groups of women mingled and exclaimed over each other , everyone began to talk about what the ball was like , champagne came in , a Congolese band whipped up their pace , and the absurd and slightly thrilling mood of the State Ball and the cosy gaiety of the party swept together .	Cheers
[MASK] had put up a board with a collage of blown-up pictures of Mweta – speaking , laughing , yawning , touching a piece of machinery with curiosity , leaving , arriving , even threatening .	Someone
Many other [MASK] Bray had seen at the ball streamed in in their finery :	people
[MASK] had contributed to the arrangements for this party .	they
The [MASK] everyone had taken gave a sense of occasion to even the wildest moments of the night .	trouble
[MASK] Bayley , queenly at twenty-six , with her beautiful , well-mannered , disciplined face , came to hover beside Bray between responsible permutations about the room to make sure that this young girl was not being bothered too much by the attentions of someone older and rather drunk , or that young man was not being overlooked by the girls who ought to be taking notice of him .	Vivien
[MASK] surprised her by asking her to dance , swaying stiffly to a rhythm he did n't know , but nevertheless keeping the beat , so that they would n't make fools of themselves among the complicated gyrations of the Africans .	Bray
I 'm so glad you dance , [MASK] said ; he was ashamed that he had asked her only out of politeness .	she
[MASK] wo n't ... I think it 's a mistake to let oneself forget these things because of vanity .	Neil
[MASK] Kente is a wonderful dancer , wonderful , is n't she ... just like a snake brought out by music , and sometimes he 'll try with her .	Tindi
[MASK] loves to flirt with her when Cyprian 's not looking , but get her doing her marvellous wriggle on the floor and he just stands there like Andrew , dragging his feet .	He
[MASK] was probably one of her children ;	Andrew
[MASK] called to Vivien and they were drawn away from the dancers to a crowded table .	Someone
A young [MASK] leaned her elbows on it and her white breasts pursed forward within the frame of her arms .	woman
Have my glass , [MASK] said , as there were no spare ones to go round .	she
[MASK] went off to dance , holding in her stomach as she squeezed past and balanced her soft-looking body .	She
[MASK] do n't remember me ?	You
Ras Asahe , [MASK] came to your place in England once .	I
The young [MASK] said he was in broadcasting now , so-called assistant to the Director of English Language Services .	man
Good Lord , [MASK] 'd like to see him again !	I
[MASK] Asahe was one of Edward Shinza 's lieutenants in the early days of PIP .	Joseph
[MASK] 's old now .	He
[MASK] was not the right question to have asked ;	It
His [MASK] , watch , cufflinks were those of a man who feels he must buy the best for himself , he had the Mussolini-jaw quite common among the people in the part of the country he came from but those hands were the lyrical , delicately strong , African ones that escaped the international blandness of businessmen 's hands as Bray had marvelled to see them escape the brutalizing of physical hardship .	clothes
[MASK] broke stones with hands like that , here .	Convicts
[MASK] made conversation about the radio and television coverage of the celebrations , and from this broke into talk that interested them both :	They
[MASK] wonder how much use could be made of a radio classroom in country schools , whether it could n't help considerably to ease the shortage of teachers , here , and maintain some sort of standard where teachers are perhaps not very well qualified .	I
[MASK] 'd like to talk to somebody about it ... your man ?	I
[MASK] 'm not keen to go straight to the Director-General ...	I
[MASK] wo n't make much difference .	It
[MASK] laughed at him again .	They
[MASK] was gathering round for servings from the roast sheep , and the fair stocky man from the airport signalled a greeting with a piece of meat in his fingers .	Everyone
Wentz , Hjalmar Wentz , [MASK] met on the plane .	we
[MASK] Dando said we probably should be seeing you at the Rhino .	Roland
[MASK] moved off with their plates of food , and Wentz said to a woman settled in one of the canvas chairs , Margot , here is Colonel Bray .	They
In the fuss to find somewhere to sit [MASK] saw the light of the fire under the spit running along the shiny planes of the woman 's face as it did on glasses and the movement of knives and forks .	he
Are n't [MASK] fat enough ...	I
But [MASK] took a tidbit of crisp fat from her husband 's fork .	she
To tell the truth , [MASK] 's the first time for a week we 've had time to sit down to eat .	this
[MASK] 's had to be in the kitchen herself from six in the morning , and some nights it 's been until ten .	Margot
[MASK] literally has n't sat down to a meal ...	She
The [MASK] went to the Independence ceremony and we have n't seen him since ... just for the afternoon , he said , just to see the great men he 's seen in the papers ... well , what can you say ?	cook
[MASK] felt it was his day , after all .	We
The [MASK] showed a wellshaped smile in the dark .	woman
[MASK] asked , How on earth have you managed ?	Bray
[MASK] gestured and laughed , but her husband was eager to break in , holding up his hands over the plate balanced on his knees .	She
[MASK] 's what it was on Thursday . And yesterday ... Only a hundred and nine , that 's all ...	That
[MASK] laughed .	They
[MASK] raised his beer mug of wine to her .	Bray
You must n't forget I 've got help , [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] put down his glass beside his chair , to do the justice of full attention to what he was going to say .	Wentz
[MASK] got him from the new labour exchange – I thought , well , let 's try it , so they send him along , five years ' experience , everything fine .	I
His [MASK] was listening , laughing softly , sitting back majestically for a moment .	wife
Five years ' experience , but d' [MASK] know what as ?	you
[MASK] know the barbers under the mango trees there just before you get to the second-class trading area ?	You
Our son 's [MASK] was the best , I think .	comment
[MASK] knows you must be crazy to come of your own free will to one of these countries .	Everyone
Colonel [MASK] is n't going to run a hotel .	Bray
[MASK] had a soft , dry voice and her accent was slighter than her husband 's .	She
[MASK] 'm not as brave as you are .	I
[MASK] did n't know what we were going to land up doing , either .	We
[MASK] said quietly , We certainly did n't think we 'd be the proprietors of the Silver Rhino .	She
Oh , did you ? [MASK] laughed .	he
Well , perhaps [MASK] am , then .	I
[MASK] should think the bar of the Silver Rhino 's as good a place as any to learn what 's really going on .	I
Mrs. [MASK] had the tone of voice that sounds as if the speaker is addressing noone but himself .	Wentz
How [MASK] still think with their blood and enjoy to contempt ... yes , the bar at the Silver Rhino .	people
Our son [MASK] is looking after it tonight .	Stephen
[MASK] keeps them in place .	He
[MASK] promised him a liberal education when we left South Africa , you see .	We
Mrs. [MASK] had put down her food and she sat back out of the light of the fire , a big face glimmering in the dark , caverns where the eyes were .	Wentz
[MASK] 're not going to finish ?	You
The white [MASK] of her hand moved in a gesture of rejection ...	blur
[MASK] have it , Hjalmar .	You
[MASK] rained and people felt chilly on the veranda and drifted indoors .	It
Now [MASK] had the sulky outraged attention of a young patriot from the social welfare department , the glittering-eyed indifference of Doris Manyema , one of the country 's three or four women graduates , and the amused appreciation of a South African refugee whose yellow-brown colour , small nose and fine lips set him apart from the blackness of the other two .	Dando
In the light , Margot Wentz 's [MASK] was the figurehead of a ship above the hulk of her body :	head
With an absent smile to Bray across the room , [MASK] took up , for a moment , an abandoned beauty .	she
When he joined the group , [MASK] were listening to her .	they
[MASK] do n't have to argue ; we can take it that colonialism is indefensible , for us , no ?	We
[MASK] think so , I think so ... right .	You
I 'm sorry , forty-eight years [MASK] were under British rule , digging their mines , building roads for them , making towns , living in shanties and waiting on them , cleaning up after them , treated like dirt ... now it 's all over , you really think there was any way at all you could enter the modern world without suffering ?	you
[MASK] think there was someone else would have given you the alphabet ! and electricity and killed off the malaria mosquito , just for love ?	You
[MASK] are the facts .	These
From your point of view , as it luckily lasted less than two generations . Was n't [MASK] worth it ?	it
Would [MASK] have let you in for nothing ?	anybody
That 's what [MASK] 'm asking ...	I
Would n't [MASK] have to pay the price in suffering ?	you
Oh [MASK] make the usual mistake of seeing the life of the African people as a blank ... and then the colonialists come along and we come to life – in your compounds and back yards .	you
[MASK] was shaking her head slowly while Odara was speaking .	She
All [MASK] 'm saying , do n't wear the sufferings of the past round your necks .	I
What does [MASK] mean – I do n't use freedom , I do n't like the big words – what does your independence mean , then ?	independence
[MASK] said , Watch out for the man from the CIA .	Someone
But if you have to do it by keeping that forty years or whatever sitting at the table with you and your children ... ach , [MASK] 's not healthy , it makes me sick .	it
What do [MASK] want to hear how you had to go round to the back door of the missionary 's house ?	they
Mrs. [MASK] had joined the group , running a big , silver-nailed hand through Curtis Pettigrew 's crew-cut hair .	Odara
[MASK] laughed .	Odara
But [MASK] always comes down to the same thing : you Europeans talk very reasonably about that sort of suffering because you do n't know ... you may have thought it was terrible , but there 's nothing like that in your lives .	it
[MASK] saw Margot Wentz put up her head with a quick grimace-smile , as if someone had told an old joke she could n't raise a laugh for .	Bray
Well , here you 're mistaken , her [MASK] said , rather grandly , we lived under Mr. Hitler .	husband
And [MASK] must know all about that .	you
[MASK] 'm not interested in Hitler .	I
My friend , white [MASK] have killed more people in Africa than Hitler ever did in Europe .	men
[MASK] 've just said one should n't burden oneself with suffering .	You
[MASK] do n't have any feelings about Hitler .	I
Oh but you should , Mrs. [MASK] said , almost dreaming .	Wentz
It 's [MASK] the same thing .	all
Well , [MASK] had my seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays in the detention camp at Fort Howard , the guest of Her Majesty 's governor , said Odara , that I know .	I
Her two brothers died at Auschwitz , [MASK] Wentz said ;	Hjalmar
but his [MASK] was talking to Jo-Ann Pettigrew , who offered blobs of toasted marshmallow on the end of a long fork .	wife
[MASK] Odara spoke to her husband as no local woman would dare ; yet he ignored it , as if turning the tables on her with his countrymen 's assumption that what women said was not heard , anyway .	Evelyn
[MASK] said angrily to Wentz , directing the remark at the wife through the husband , What did you get in return that was worth it ?	He
[MASK] Wentz said , looking at no one , That one ca n't say .	Margot
[MASK] waggled her fingers , sticky from the marshmallow , and her husband took his handkerchief from his pocket and gave it to her .	She
[MASK] was the evening when Bray , Neil , Evelyn Odara , one of the South African refugees , the Pettigrews , and a few others set off for the Sputnik Bar .	It
While Bray was standing about in the group with the Odaras and the Wentzes , [MASK] Pettigrew , having failed to get him to eat her last marshmallow , put it in her mouth and signalled to everyone there was something they must hear .	Jo-Ann
[MASK] 's been to the Sputnik and she says it 's terrific now .	Rebecca
[MASK] 've knocked out a wall into that sort of yard thing and they have dancing .	They
With [MASK] laid on .	girls
[MASK] said , Hey ?	Neil
And which [MASK] of us 's been taking Rebecca to the Sputnik ?	one
[MASK] rose .	Laughter
Well , why do n't [MASK] all go , that 's what I want t' know .	we
The young Pettigrew [MASK] was always in a state of enthusiasm ;	woman
her long curly [MASK] had sprung out , diademed with raindrops , because she had done her marshmallow toasting outside over the spit fire .	hair
[MASK] was an anthropologist , and Bray accepted this as an explanation for her passion for arranging excursions , on which she carried her baby tied on her back , African style .	She
No , no – well , [MASK] took her ...	Ras
So [MASK] 's it , now .	that
[MASK] Edwards came in from the veranda , smiling good-naturedly , inquiringly , under the remarks shied at her .	Rebecca
[MASK] said , There 're bulbs like you see in films round the star 's dressing-table , and they light up and spell INDEPENDENCE HURRAH .	She
In great confusion , there and then [MASK] decided to go .	they
[MASK] refused and Vivien had to go home to the children , and Rebecca Edwards protested that hers were alone too .	Dando
[MASK] insisted that Bray must come ;	Neil
[MASK] was one of those people who , late at night , suddenly have a desperate need of certain companions .	he
But when Neil , Bray , Evelyn Odara and the South African got down to the second-class trading area , the [MASK] had n't arrived .	others
[MASK] went into the Sputnik Bar for a moment , meeting music like a buffeting about the head , and then someone said that he thought the arrangement had been to meet at the railway crossing .	They
[MASK] went all the way back into town to the flats where the Edwards girl lived ...	They
[MASK] stood on the moonlit patch of earth in front of the dark building and called up , but there was no response .	Neil
[MASK] stopped somewhere to give a man a lift ; he was caught in the lights , hat in hand ; only his clean white shirt had shown on the dark road .	They
[MASK] answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop for a black one on the road , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch .	He
[MASK] , back in this country once more , again aware of his own height and size and pinkness almost like some form of aggression he was n't responsible for , knew that the fellow was holding himself away from contact with him .	Bray
The [MASK] of Evelyn , Neil , and the South African flew about the car ;	voices
[MASK] passed the shadows of the mango trees in the bright moonlight lying beneath the trees like sleeping beasts ;	they
Not for the first time , an [MASK] had broken out over breakfast at number four , Privet Drive .	argument
[MASK] tried , yet again , to explain .	Harry
If [MASK] could just let her out at night –	I
[MASK] exchanged dark looks with his wife , Petunia .	He
[MASK] tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long , loud belch from the Dursleys son , Dudley .	Harry
[MASK] must feed you up while we 've got the chance . I do n't like the sound of that school food	We
[MASK] , who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair , grinned and turned to Harry .	Dudley
The [MASK] of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible : Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen ; Mrs Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth ; Mr Dursley jumped to his feet , veins throbbing in his temples .	effect
[MASK] stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt , who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet .	Harry
Uncle [MASK] sat back down , breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small , sharp eyes .	Vernon
ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays , Uncle [MASK] had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment , because Harry Potter was n't a normal boy .	Vernon
As a matter of fact , [MASK] was as not normal as it is possible to be .	he
[MASK] Potter was a wizard – a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .	Harry
And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays , [MASK] was nothing to how Harry felt .	it
[MASK] missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomach ache .	He
What did the [MASK] care if Harry lost his place in the house Quidditch team because he had n't practised all summer ?	Dursleys
The [MASK] were what wizards called Muggles ( not a drop of magical blood in their veins ) and as far as they were concerned , having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame .	Dursleys
Uncle [MASK] had even padlocked Harry 's owl , Hedwig , inside her cage , to stop her carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world .	Vernon
[MASK] looked nothing like the rest of the family .	Harry
Uncle [MASK] was large and neckless , with an enormous black moustache ; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony ; Dudley was blond , pink and porky .	Vernon
[MASK] , on the other hand , was small and skinny , with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy .	Harry
[MASK] wore round glasses , and on his forehead was a thin , lightning-shaped scar .	He
This [MASK] was the only hint of Harry 's very mysterious past , of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys doorstep eleven years before .	scar
At the age of one , [MASK] had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time , Lord Voldemort , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak .	Harry
Harry 's [MASK] had died in Voldemort 's attack , but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar , and somehow – nobody understood why – Voldemort 's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry .	parents
[MASK] had spent ten years with the Dursleys , never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to , believing the Dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash which had killed his parents .	He
And then , exactly a year ago , [MASK] had written to Harry , and the whole story had come out .	Hogwarts
[MASK] had taken up his place at wizard school , where he and his scar were famous , but now the school year was over , and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer , back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly .	Harry
The [MASK] had n't even remembered that today happened to be Harry 's twelfth birthday .	Dursleys
of course , his [MASK] had n't been high ; they 'd never given him a proper present , let alone a cake – but to ignore it completely .	hopes
[MASK] looked up , hardly daring to believe it .	Harry
[MASK] went back to his toast .	Harry
of course , [MASK] thought bitterly , Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party .	he
[MASK] 'd been talking of nothing else for a fortnight .	He
Some rich [MASK] and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him ( Uncle Vernon 's company made drills ) .	builder
[MASK] put on a foul , simpering smile .	Dudley
Then [MASK] rounded on Harry .	he
Now , [MASK] should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner .	we
[MASK] was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry .	This
Aunt [MASK] burst into tears and hugged her son , while Harry ducked under the table so they would n't see him laughing .	Petunia
[MASK] fought to keep his face straight as he emerged .	Harry
When dinner 's over , [MASK] take Mrs Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills .	you
With any luck , [MASK] 'll have the deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten .	I
[MASK] could n't feel too excited about this .	Harry
[MASK] did n't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did in Privet Drive .	He
[MASK] left through the back door .	Harry
[MASK] was a brilliant , sunny day .	It
[MASK] crossed the lawn , slumped down on the garden bench , and sang under his breath : " Happy birthday to me . Happy birthday to me "	He
[MASK] gazed miserably into the hedge .	He
[MASK] had never felt so lonely .	He
More than anything else at Hogwarts , more even than playing Quidditch , [MASK] missed his best friends , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger .	Harry
[MASK] , however , did n't seem to be missing him at all .	They
[MASK] of them had written to him all summer , even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay .	Neither
Countless times , [MASK] had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it was n't worth the risk .	Harry
[MASK] had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick .	Harry
For the first couple of weeks back , [MASK] had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him .	Harry
But the long [MASK] from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal – and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday .	silence
What would n't [MASK] give now for a message from Hogwarts ?	he
[MASK] 'd almost be glad of a sight of his arch-enemy , Draco Malfoy , just to be sure it had n't all been a dream .	He
Not that his whole [MASK] at Hogwarts had been fun .	year
At the very end of last term , [MASK] had come face to face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself .	Harry
[MASK] might be a ruin of his former self , but he was still terrifying , still cunning , still determined to regain power .	Voldemort
[MASK] had slipped through Voldemort 's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes .	Harry
[MASK] suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench .	Harry
[MASK] had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge – and the hedge was staring back .	He
Two enormous green [MASK] had appeared among the leaves .	eyes
[MASK] jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn .	Harry
The huge [MASK] blinked and vanished .	eyes
So [MASK] 've finally learned the days of the week .	you
[MASK] hitched up his trousers , which were slipping down his fat bottom .	Dudley
Why 're you staring at the hedge ? [MASK] said suspiciously .	he
[MASK] stumbled backwards at once , a look of panic on his fat face .	Dudley
[MASK] paid dearly for his moment of fun .	Harry
As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt [MASK] knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan .	Petunia
Then [MASK] gave him work to do , with the promise he would n't eat again until he 'd finished .	she
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams , [MASK] cleaned the windows , washed the car , mowed the lawn , trimmed the flowerbeds , pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench .	Harry
The [MASK] blazed overhead , burning the back of his neck .	sun
[MASK] knew he should n't have risen to Dudley 's bait , but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself maybe he did n't have any friends at Hogwarts	Harry
[MASK] moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen .	Harry
A [MASK] of roast pork was sizzling in the oven .	joint
[MASK] was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress .	She
[MASK] washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper .	Harry
The moment he had finished , Aunt [MASK] whisked away his plate .	Petunia
As he passed the door to the living room , [MASK] caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow-ties and dinner jackets .	Harry
[MASK] had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon 's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs .	He
[MASK] crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed .	Harry
The [MASK] was , there was already someone sitting on it .	trouble
[MASK] managed not to shout out , but it was a close thing .	Harry
The little [MASK] on the bed had large , bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls .	creature
[MASK] knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning .	Harry
As they stared at each other , [MASK] heard Dudley 's voice from the hall .	Harry
May [MASK] take your coats , Mr and Mrs Mason ?	I
The [MASK] slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet .	creature
[MASK] noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase , with rips for arm and leg holes .	Harry
Er – [MASK] do n't want to be rude or anything , but – this is n't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom .	I
Aunt Petunias high , false [MASK] sounded from the living room .	laugh
The [MASK] hung his head .	elf
[MASK] goggled through the bars at him as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw .	People
Then the [MASK] appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage , laughing at him .	Dursleys
[MASK] opened his eyes .	He
[MASK] was shining through the bars on the window .	Moonlight
And [MASK] was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone .	someone
[MASK] Weasley was outside Harry 's window .	Ron
Harry 's [MASK] fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him .	mouth
[MASK] was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car , which was parked in mid-air .	Ron
Why have n't [MASK] been answering my letters ?	you
[MASK] moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig , who seemed to have realised how important this was and kept still and silent .	Harry
The [MASK] revved louder and louder and suddenly , with a crunching noise , the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air – Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground .	car
Panting , [MASK] hoisted them up into the car .	Ron
[MASK] listened anxiously , but there was no sound from the Dursleys bedroom .	Harry
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron , [MASK] reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window .	Fred
[MASK] and George climbed carefully through the window into Harry 's room .	Fred
Watch out for the bottom stair , it creaks , [MASK] whispered back , as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing .	Harry
[MASK] dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them out of the window to Ron .	Harry
Then [MASK] went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs .	he
[MASK] heard Uncle Vernon cough .	Harry
At last , panting , [MASK] reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry 's room to the open window .	they
[MASK] climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side .	Fred
Inch by inch , the [MASK] slid through the window .	trunk
Uncle [MASK] coughed again .	Vernon
[MASK] and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car .	Harry
[MASK] tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on .	Harry
[MASK] snatched up Hedwig 's cage , dashed to the window and passed it out to Ron .	He
[MASK] was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door – and it crashed open .	He
For a split second , Uncle [MASK] stood framed in the doorway ; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry , grabbing him by the ankle .	Vernon
[MASK] , Fred and George seized Harry 's arms and pulled as hard as they could .	Ron
But the [MASK] gave a gigantic tug and Harry 's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon 's grasp .	Weasleys
[MASK] could n't believe it – he was free .	Harry
[MASK] wound down the window , the night air whipping his hair , and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive .	He
Uncle [MASK] , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all hanging , dumbstruck , out of Harry 's window .	Vernon
The [MASK] roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear .	Weasleys
[MASK] handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost .	George
[MASK] told them all about Dobby , the warning he 'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding .	Harry
[MASK] saw Fred and George look at each other .	He
[MASK] reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts .	I
[MASK] was a big supporter of You Know Who .	He
[MASK] had heard these rumours about Malfoy 's family before , and they did n't surprise him at all .	Harry
[MASK] Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind , thoughtful and sensitive boy .	Draco
[MASK] was silent .	Harry
Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything , his family were rolling in wizard gold ; [MASK] could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house .	he
Had [MASK] been stupid to take Dobby seriously ?	Harry
[MASK] thought it was Errol 's fault at first –	I
[MASK] 's ancient .	He
[MASK] would n't be the first time he 'd collapsed on a delivery .	It
[MASK] mean , there 's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge .	I
You 're driving too far west , Fred , [MASK] added , pointing at a compass on the dashboard .	he
[MASK] twiddled the steering wheel .	Fred
Like , last year , some old [MASK] died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop .	witch
This Muggle [MASK] bought it , took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it .	woman
[MASK] happened ?	What
[MASK] laughed .	Fred
[MASK] takes it apart , puts spells on it and puts it back together again .	He
If he raided our house [MASK] 'd have to put himself straight under arrest .	he
[MASK] drives Mum mad .	It
A faint pinkish [MASK] was visible along the horizon to the east .	glow
[MASK] brought the car lower and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees .	Fred
The [MASK] of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees .	edge
[MASK] had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron 's house .	They
[MASK] looked as though it had once been a large stone pigsty , but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several storeys high and so crooked it looked as though it was held up by magic ( which , Harry reminded himself , it probably was ) .	It
Several fat brown [MASK] were pecking their way around the yard .	chickens
[MASK] got out of the car .	They
Then , Ron , [MASK] come bounding downstairs going , Mum , look who turned up in the night ! and she 'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car .	you
[MASK] had gone a nasty greenish colour , his eyes fixed on the house .	Ron
The other [MASK] wheeled around .	three
Mrs [MASK] was marching across the yard , scattering chickens , and for a short , plump , kind-faced woman , it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger .	Weasley
Mrs [MASK] came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next .	Weasley
[MASK] was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket .	She
So , [MASK] said .	she
All [MASK] of Mrs Weasley 's sons were taller than she was , but they cowered as her rage broke over them .	three
[MASK] gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care ? never , as long as I 've lived you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy	Car
[MASK] seemed to go on for hours .	It
Mrs [MASK] had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry , who backed away .	Weasley
[MASK] turned and walked back into the house and Harry , after a nervous glance at Ron , who nodded encouragingly , followed her .	She
The [MASK] was small and rather cramped .	kitchen
[MASK] had never been in a wizard house before .	He
The [MASK] on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all .	clock
Mrs [MASK] was clattering around , cooking breakfast a little haphazardly , throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan .	Weasley
[MASK] and I have been worried about you , too .	Arthur
Just last night [MASK] were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday .	we
[MASK] flicked her wand casually at the washing-up in the sink , which began to clean itself , clinking gently in the background .	She
Blimey , [MASK] 'm tired , yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last .	I
And [MASK] pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece .	she
[MASK] groaned .	George
[MASK] looked at the cover of Mrs Weasley 's book .	Harry
Or [MASK] might well fall out of the wrong fireplace –	you
Trying hard to bear all this in mind , [MASK] took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire .	Harry
[MASK] took a deep breath , scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward ; the fire felt like a warm breeze ; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash .	He
[MASK] felt as though he was being sucked down a giant plug hole .	It
[MASK] seemed to be spinning very fast	He
[MASK] tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick	he
[MASK] hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly , still spinning and spinning	something
now [MASK] felt as though cold hands were slapping his face	it
squinting through his glasses [MASK] saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond	he
his bacon [MASK] were churning inside him .	sandwiches
[MASK] closed his eyes again wishing it would stop , and then – he fell , face forward , onto cold stone and felt his glasses shatter .	He
Dizzy and bruised , covered in soot , [MASK] got gingerly to his feet , holding his broken glasses up to his eyes .	he
[MASK] was quite alone , but where he was , he had no idea .	He
All he could tell was that [MASK] was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large , dimly lit wizard 's shop – but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list .	he
A glass [MASK] nearby held a withered hand on a cushion , a blood-stained pack of cards , and a staring glass eye .	case
Evil-looking [MASK] stared down from the walls , an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter , and rusty , spiked instruments hung from the ceiling .	masks
The sooner [MASK] got out of here , the better .	he
[MASK] looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left ; he shot inside it and pulled the doors to leaving a small crack to peer through .	Harry
Seconds later , a [MASK] clanged , and Malfoy stepped into the shop .	bell
The [MASK] who followed could only be his father .	man
[MASK] had the same pale , pointed face and identical cold grey eyes .	He
[MASK] bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls .	Malfoy
A stooping [MASK] had appeared behind the counter , smoothing his greasy hair back from his face .	man
How may [MASK] be of assistance ?	I
The [MASK] faded slightly from Mr Borgin 's face .	smile
Mr [MASK] fixed a pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list .	Borgin
Mr Malfoy 's [MASK] curled .	lip
The name [MASK] still commands a certain respect , yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome .	Malfoy
[MASK] felt a hot surge of anger .	Harry
– and as you see , [MASK] of these poisons might make it appear –	certain
The [MASK] all have favourites , that Hermione Granger –	teachers
[MASK] started to haggle .	They
[MASK] watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place , examining the objects for sale .	Harry
[MASK] paused to examine a long coil of hangman 's rope and to read , smirking , the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals :	He
[MASK] turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him .	Draco
[MASK] walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle	He
[MASK] wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away .	Harry
The moment the door had closed , Mr [MASK] dropped his oily manner .	Borgin
Muttering darkly , Mr [MASK] disappeared into a back room .	Borgin
[MASK] waited for a minute in case he came back , then , quietly as he could , slipped out of the cabinet , past the glass cases , and out of the shop door .	Harry
Clutching his broken glasses to his face [MASK] stared around .	he
[MASK] had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts .	He
The [MASK] he 'd just left , Borgin and Burkes , looked like the largest , but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads , and two doors down , a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders .	one
Two shabby-looking [MASK] were watching him from the shadow of a doorway , muttering to each other .	wizards
Feeling jumpy , [MASK] set off , trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he 'd be able to find a way out of there .	Harry
An old wooden street [MASK] hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley .	sign
[MASK] did n't help , as Harry had never heard of such a place .	This
[MASK] supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys fire .	He
Trying to stay calm , [MASK] wondered what to do .	he
An aged [MASK] stood in front of him , holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails .	witch
[MASK] leered at him , showing mossy teeth .	She
[MASK] backed away .	Harry
[MASK] 'm just –	I
Harry 's [MASK] leapt .	heart
[MASK] seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch , knocking the tray right out of her hands .	Hagrid
Her [MASK] followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight .	shrieks
[MASK] saw a familiar , snow-white marble building in the distance : Gringotts Bank .	Harry
[MASK] had steered him right into Diagon Alley .	Hagrid
[MASK] 're ruinin' the school cabbages .	They
[MASK] set off together down the street .	They
[MASK] explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys .	Harry
[MASK] looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts .	Harry
[MASK] ran down to meet them , her bushy brown hair flying behind her .	She
Are [MASK] coming into Gringotts , Harry ?	you
[MASK] and Hermione looked around : sprinting up the crowded street were Ron , Fred , George , Percy and Mr Weasley .	Harry
[MASK] mopped his glistening bald patch .	He
[MASK] 's frantic – she 's coming now .	Molly
Mrs [MASK] now came galloping into view , her handbag swinging wildly in one hand , Ginny just clinging onto the other .	Weasley
Gasping for breath [MASK] pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid had n't managed to beat away .	she
Mr [MASK] took Harry 's glasses , gave them a tap of his wand and returned them , good as new .	Weasley
And [MASK] strode away , head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street .	he
Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes ? [MASK] asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps .	Harry
Oh , [MASK] 'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something	I
[MASK] 's that you 've got there ?	What
Oh , [MASK] 're changing Muggle money .	you
[MASK] pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr Granger 's hand .	He
[MASK] enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys vault , but felt dreadful , far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley , when it was opened .	Harry
Mrs [MASK] felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag .	Weasley
[MASK] felt even worse when they reached his vault .	Harry
[MASK] tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag .	He
Back outside on the marble steps , [MASK] all separated .	they
[MASK] muttered vaguely about needing a new quill .	Percy
[MASK] and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts , Lee Jordan .	Fred
Mrs [MASK] and Ginny were going to a second-hand robe shop . Mr Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink .	Weasley
[MASK] , Ron and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street .	Harry
The [MASK] of gold , silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry 's pocket was clamouring to be spent , so he bought three large strawberry and peanut-butter ice-creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley , examining the fascinating shop windows .	bag
A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , [MASK] read aloud off the back cover .	Ron
An hour later , [MASK] headed for Flourish and Blotts .	they
[MASK] were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop .	They
As they approached it , [MASK] saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors , trying to get in .	they
[MASK] LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 to 4:30 pm .	GILDEROY
[MASK] mean , he 's written almost the whole booklist !	I
[MASK] , Ron , and Hermione squeezed inside .	Harry
A long [MASK] wound right to the back of the shop , where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books .	line
[MASK] each grabbed a copy of Break with a Banshee , and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr and Mrs Granger .	They
[MASK] sounded breathless and kept patting her hair .	She
[MASK] Lockhart came slowly into view , seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face , all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd .	Gilderoy
The real [MASK] was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue which exactly matched his eyes ; his pointed wizard 's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair .	Lockhart
A short , irritable-looking [MASK] was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash .	man
[MASK] had seen it happen to others .	I
[MASK] did not want it to happen to me .	I
But [MASK] is turning the wheel ?	who
Honest Guv ' [MASK] had both hands tied behind my back .	I
Neither my [MASK] nor my father were able to cope with the 1960s .	mother
[MASK] were too short , hair was too long , and the favoured colour combination of purple and orange made my mother look like a vampire and my father a Matisse .	Skirts
[MASK] were peculiarly ill-placed for the general assault on the past that the Sixties represented because they lived in Liverpool .	They
[MASK] , that should have slumbered its way through the Sixties as it had every other decade , produced the Beatles .	Liverpool
My [MASK] were victims of the Merseybeat .	parents
My [MASK] whelped me in a mess of blankets while my noctivagant father towed in the big ships .	mother
Why then did [MASK] trouble the surface ?	I
' Are you waiting for someone ? ' [MASK] said .	I
' [MASK] was . '	I
' We 're going to live in London , ' [MASK] said .	he
' Because [MASK] has a new job . '	Daddy
[MASK] was here , wrapped from head to foot in woollens , her face entirely obscured by a seaman 's balaclava .	Grandmother
[MASK] made us a cup of cocoa and my mother swept off in a taxi .	She
[MASK] woke up in the dazed apartment .	I
[MASK] crept from beneath the scissored blankets to the bathroom .	I
The [MASK] and chrome was a shrine to Chanel .	white
One day when my mother was taking me to school , the [MASK] seemed very quiet .	streets
[MASK] parked , although we were the only car on the stretch of road , and we got out to walk slowly , hand in hand , through some flimsy barriers of paper and string .	We
Far away [MASK] saw some policemen waving at us and we waved back .	we
[MASK] heard a lorry coming up behind and my mother told me it had a television crew on board which excited me who had never seen a television .	We
[MASK] that had been on the market for as little as ten years was unlikely to impress my father .	Anything
' Are [MASK] happy , Alice ? '	you
[MASK] should have been fun but neither of them was happy .	It
When I was five my [MASK] was on pills and my mother was on gin .	father
[MASK] think I was happy , in the maddening determined way that children have of being happy , and it was that happiness that worked as a magnet on both of my parents .	I
At last [MASK] arrived at a small diner in a beaten-up part of town .	we
[MASK] swung inside and we sat at a menacingly nice checked-cloth table with red carnations and a few rods of grissini .	She
A [MASK] came out with a carafe of red wine and a bowl of olives .	boy
[MASK] handed us the menus as if this was just an ordinary dinner in an ordinary day .	He
[MASK] had fallen into the hands of the Borgias and now they wanted me to eat .	I
When he stopped holding me up to the light [MASK] began to hold me up to the mirror .	he
[MASK] wanted to compare us , side by side , did I look like him ?	He
[MASK] had enough money .	He
His [MASK] interpreted the resentment as a normal response to a difficult situation .	friends
My [MASK] took the simple view that a man must have his work .	mother
My [MASK] though , was not simple and he was still aware enough to turn the mask over and over in his hands and ask what it was .	father
Uncharacteristically , [MASK] went to visit my grandmother .	he
Months later , proud complacent [MASK] had a headache and yowled his way over the earth , threatening to split the firmament with pain .	Zeus
But [MASK] was in the future , and in 1959 my father was in the fullness of his present , he could do no wrong .	that
As the lorry came close to us , four young [MASK] dressed entirely in black ran past .	men
[MASK] of them carried guitars , one had a set of drumsticks .	Three
[MASK] had seen people dressed in black before .	I
Husband and wife . Man and rib . [MASK] could be more normal than that ?	What
And now [MASK] were having a baby .	they
That is , my [MASK] was bearing my father 's child .	mother
[MASK] born fully formed from the head of Zeus .	Athene
My [MASK] no longer wanted herring heads .	father
[MASK] wanted mink and pearls and he got them .	He
Like most men [MASK] was a transvestite at one remove ; if his wife was part of him so were her clothes .	he
[MASK] was his rib and as such he too wore a silk shift .	She
[MASK] loved her clothes , loved to see her dressed up , it satisfied a part of him that was deeper than vanity .	He
[MASK] was a part of himself .	It
[MASK] completed him .	She
[MASK] manifested him at another level .	She
[MASK] absorbed her while she failed to absorb him .	He
[MASK] was so normal that nobody noticed it .	This
Her [MASK] had strings of onions and fat hams hanging in glorious torture from twisted hooks in the ceiling .	kitchen
[MASK] smoked her own kippers up the chimney , skewering them in pairs with discarded knitting needles .	She
For this [MASK] kept a wood fire .	she
[MASK] had a glass-fronted cabinet lined with jars of homemade preserve ; pickles , tomatoes , pears , cabbage , and in the middle , a baby rabbit .	She
[MASK] was not for eating .	This
[MASK] was an ornament .	It
When the wind blew and the cupboard rattled the [MASK] bobbed up and down in his transparent prison , his ears buckling slightly as they hit the lid seal .	rabbit
Like my grandmother [MASK] kept secrets the way other people keep fish .	he
[MASK] were a hobby , a fascination , his underwater collection of the rare and the strange .	They
Occasionally [MASK] would float up to the surface , unexpected , unexplained .	something
' Tha [MASK] 's to give birth . '	wife
[MASK] was not resourceful ; her class did not allow it , and I know it worried my grandmother that her son had found a wife who did not know how to make a soup out of herring 's heads .	She
' [MASK] christen this child ... '	I
[MASK] did n't come home that night , nor the night after .	He
The [MASK] rang each evening at six o'clock until a week had passed .	telephone
My [MASK] looked vaguer than usual and kept her light on all night .	mother
Now that it was winter the [MASK] was dark almost all day and the frost whitened the lawn .	house
My [MASK] and I played quietly in the petrified air , our breath briefly warming the frozen spaces around us .	sisters
[MASK] were waiting , waiting , watching the clock .	We
Before we left [MASK] went to see my headmaster .	we
[MASK] had just started secondary school and was restless and inattentive .	I
The [MASK] , noting that I had every advantage life could offer , assumed that I was either a bad child or a dull one .	headmaster
[MASK] was too afraid of my rugger-square father to use either of those words , at least I know that now , but at the time I believed he meant what he said .	He
For the next eight years [MASK] lived shut away in the misery of his drawer .	I
[MASK] saw their faces streaked with tears pressed in agony against the windows and windscreen of the car .	I
[MASK] can hardly have lasted a moment ; they realised their prey was elsewhere and vanished as devilishly as they had appeared .	It
When my mother got out to talk to the policeman , the only [MASK] of what had happened was a broken banner painted HELP !	trace
The [MASK] was plain : a scrubbed sycamore table , a deep enamel sink , a few unmatched chairs and an evil-smelling Rayburn that left soot on my grandmother 's scones .	furniture
As I was ready to go with my nightcase packed , my [MASK] gave me a bottle of disinfectant .	mother
' For the out-house , ' [MASK] said .	she
My [MASK] had been an honorary member of the secret police since she was born .	grandmother
As I came through the back door into her kitchen [MASK] frisked me from head to foot , removed the disinfectant and gave me a pair of overalls to wear .	she
' Help me clean out the toilet , ' [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] began to dread the parties ; the unknown women who would come upstairs to cry in a spare bedroom .	I
[MASK] persuaded my parents to let me go and stay with my grandmother on party nights .	I
My [MASK] was reluctant because she thought my grandmother was unhygienic .	mother
' Where has [MASK] gone ? '	she
And [MASK] would stare at me in that way of his , trying to see happiness the way he could see a business opportunity .	he
If that sounds cruel [MASK] is only the cruelty of too close observation for too long .	it
Unable to express their feelings in the normal course of days and hours [MASK] need every legitimate excuse to do so .	they
[MASK] can not say ' I love you ' so they say ' Is n't she lovely ? ' ' Well done . '	They
[MASK] can seem like bon viveurs , always a party in the offing , my mother planning a new recipe for canapés even in the act of stuffing my relatives with the ones she has just made .	They
When they reached the docks my [MASK] backed into a loading bay and my grandmother stepped out of the shadows .	father
Whilst I was adjusting to this unlikely apparition , my [MASK] was doing the Twist or perhaps it would be better to say the Wiggle , since the two mobile parts were her bottom and her head .	grandmother
Her [MASK] , bent at the elbow , were rigid in front of her , her feet were planted apart .	arms
When we had finished scooping out the dunny , and put fresh sawdust in the bottom to activate the new midden , my [MASK] said she had a surprise for me .	grandmother
[MASK] made me stand in the corner of the kitchen behind the memorial oilskin , while she wheezed and whirred something out of the coal-hole .	She
[MASK] could hear a crackling and a scratching and what sounded like fluff on the end of a record-player needle .	I
[MASK] looked at the menu .	I
[MASK] TASTES BETTER IN ITALIAN .	FOOD
[MASK] grew .	I
At nine , tall and silent , [MASK] was unhappy .	I
My [MASK] , who had given up his religion but not the superstition that accompanied it , interpreted my misery as proof positive of Original Sin .	father
Since there could be no reason for me to be unhappy , [MASK] must be the human condition .	unhappiness
How could [MASK] hope to escape what an innocent child could not escape ?	he
Like my grandmother , [MASK] had a Gothic disposition , but she had kept her God and therefore her mercy .	he
My [MASK] could find no mercy for himself and offered none .	father
' Did [MASK] tell you that ? '	he
' This is where I met him , ' [MASK] said .	she
In my nightmares [MASK] scooped up the sea in his hood and carried it away .	Time
[MASK] stood at the end of the world and poured the sea into space .	He
[MASK] one will doubt that my father had wanted a boy .	No
[MASK] had assumed he would have a boy .	He
Right up to a week after my birth [MASK] continued to say , ' How is he ? '	he
My [MASK] told me that he had turned me upside down in his huge hands and held me V-legged to the light , just to be sure that my genitals were n't caught inside .	grandmother
[MASK] did n't trust doctors .	He
The white [MASK] and stethoscope seemed to him to be a hide-out from the world .	coat
[MASK] resented the superiority , the authority , but of course he had never been ill .	He
[MASK] would be greying , she would be lined , she would be overweight , she would be clothes-careless .	She
[MASK] could see her , hair and flesh escaping , hope trapped inside .	I
[MASK] would drain her to the sump .	I
' David [MASK] 've got everything you wanted . '	you
' What did [MASK] want ? '	I
' Did n't [MASK] want to be somebody ? '	you
My parents ' [MASK] was so clean it made me ill .	house
Worse , my [MASK] had discovered nylon , so easy to wash , and ignored my athlete 's foot and the red weals between my legs where the nylon lace of the nylon knickers warred against my non-nylon skin .	mother
[MASK] and daughter , secular , apart .	Mother
[MASK] beckoning the child in unwatched moments , taking her into his secret room , showing her symbols and precious stones .	Papa
[MASK] had navigated her parents ' hostile waters with a child 's discretion , learning to keep from one the confessions of the other .	She
My [MASK] got down a pair of kippers and broiled them for us in butter and water .	grandmother
[MASK] asked me about my father , watching my body not listening to what I said , what could I say ?	She
[MASK] loved him and he frightened me .	I
[MASK] did not speak of it again .	They
My [MASK] took his hat and scarf and walked down to the docks .	father
[MASK] drank together . He drank alone .	They
[MASK] wanted to go with them to the filthy Admiral Arms but what right had he to sit in his cups when they would be going home to cheap rations and unpaid bills ?	He
[MASK] desperately wanted to say , ' I am unhappy . '	He
How could [MASK] say that to them ?	he
' Is it a funeral ? ' [MASK] asked my mother .	I
On the sixth day of his absence my [MASK] appeared in the dining room , in her mink coat , carrying a small suitcase .	mother
The [MASK] of us were doing a jigsaw while the inadequate fire tried to melt the icicles that were hanging in long spears around the room .	three
' I have to go to your father , ' [MASK] said and kissed us with her cold red mouth .	she
' [MASK] will be here . '	Grandmother
Her stocking [MASK] were straight , her hair was curled , her back was upright , her waist was curved , her legs were long , her breasts round , her stomach was flat , her bottom was not .	seams
For the first time in months [MASK] felt my body slacken .	I
[MASK] had been carrying myself like a gun , cocked , alert , ready for trouble , fearing it .	I
My [MASK] were rowing and when they were n't rowing they were snapping and when they were n't snapping they were planning a party , holding a party , cleaning up after a party .	parents
Here , shovelling human compost out of my grandmother 's cloaca , [MASK] was happy again .	I
[MASK] stacked the rich mould around her roses and she sang me ballads from the docks , easing her voice with regular swigs from an unmarked tin-billy .	We
' Grog-blossom , ' [MASK] said tapping her nose the colour of the roses .	she
The [MASK] was warm , trade wind with generosity and travel in it , a wind to scatter the ships to the four corners of the earth and although my father was too young for ships with sails , like other water-men , the wind still excited him .	wind
[MASK] and passengers alike preferred to fly and as shipping costs increased air prices dropped .	Cargo
My father 's [MASK] , man and boy , was suffering unsustainable losses .	company
[MASK] Shipping , funded 1809 , was slowly going bankrupt and taking my father with it .	Trident
[MASK] worked for a shipping company and had done so since he was fifteen .	He
[MASK] had started at the end of the war as an office boy and fourteen years later was to be made a director of the line .	He
To celebrate [MASK] made love to my mother and I was conceived .	he
[MASK] helped Grandmother unpack her things ; a week 's supply of kippers and her Bible .	I
[MASK] opened it at the marker and found that we were back at the Book of Job .	I
[MASK] meant my grandmother was in tribulation , though on this occasion her tribulation had a kind of glittering intensity about it that heated the indifferent house and made us excited again .	This
Very often [MASK] said , ' The horse that crieth among the trumpets Aha ! ' and I wondered what kind of a horse it was that would do that .	she
Undeterred , [MASK] imitated him and soon the zero house was filled with smells and smoke and voices crying Aha !	we
[MASK] said , ' If we were good always would we be happy always ? '	I
[MASK] were his happiest times , the times when his paperwork was done , when he could hear his secretary rattling at the upright Remington as though it were a church piano .	These
[MASK] worked evenings and early mornings so that he could make a gap to slip through , a private space after coffee and before lunch , when the piers were busy with every kind of activity , legitimate and not .	He
[MASK] did teach me and we did not tell my mother or my father about the privy or the scones or the dancing lessons or the unnamed grog or the teenage turntable in its vinyl zip case or the happiness that was unhygienic or the sense of peace that had the smell of buttered kippers .	She
[MASK] had booked his old room and even packed a tie he used to wear in those days .	He
Red silk with little white polka dots , [MASK] never would say who had given it to him .	he
My [MASK] swung us up in his arms and laughed and said we were going on an adventure .	father
The glittering [MASK] were stars .	fish
My [MASK] had heard that Cunard , the most illustrious and prestigious shipping line in the United Kingdom , was to be bought up by Trafalgar House Investments .	father
[MASK] had recently taken delivery of their new flagship , the QE2 , and were making money on her .	Cunard
My [MASK] had been to the launch party in Southampton and met a few men he liked and who had liked him .	father
[MASK] of them had been to one of his foie gras parties .	Two
[MASK] of them had suggested he might consider a key role in the reorganisation of the Cunard enterprise , with particular responsibility for the QE2 's Atlantic crossings .	One
For my father [MASK] seemed like the dream again , youth again , just married again , a place where the sea was still alive and where he too would be alive .	it
Cunard 's [MASK] were in London and in a matter of weeks so were we .	headquarters
[MASK] did n't answer .	She
[MASK] was looking back down the road .	She
Suddenly [MASK] picked me up and shot a full pelt back to our car .	she
[MASK] did n't know my mother could run .	I
[MASK] had never seen her run .	I
[MASK] threw me in the back seat and flung herself in after me in a whirl of Dior and hairpins .	She
The [MASK] , his idea , was a three-day cruise to chase the comet Kohoutek , named after the Czech astronomer who had discovered it .	idea
[MASK] may lose its appeal but portents are popular .	Religion
Unfortunately the [MASK] was so bad that most of the adults found their best visions in a champagne bottle .	weather
My [MASK] was very busy and I was left alone .	father
[MASK] of his family had worn clean clothes to work , that was their pride , but none had ever worn clean clothes home .	All
My [MASK] went to work clean and he came home clean .	father
[MASK] was an endless source of satisfaction to my grandmother who never lost her own whiff of elbow grease but delighted in the sweet smell of success .	This
[MASK] had a long stride though I was taller .	She
Soon [MASK] were at the Battery .	we
[MASK] has it that the Ship , while seeking the Holy Grail , sailed off the end of the world and continued forever .	Legend
At particular conjunctions of time and timelessness , [MASK] appears again as a bright light , shooting its course through the unfathomable universe , chasing that which has neither beginning nor end .	it
Sighing , [MASK] threw down his cigarette and went inside , straightening his tie .	he
[MASK] listened briefly .	He
Then [MASK] threw down the receiver and threw his secretary up into the air .	he
For myself , in the dark , watching the thin silver line speed away , [MASK] had joined that band of pilgrims uncenturied , unquantified , who , call it art , call it alchemy , call it science , call it god , are driven by a light that will not stay .	I
The Godspeed . My [MASK] at the wheel . My mother on a hard couch giving birth to me .	father
My [MASK] lay with her skirts up over her face , her perfect stockings round her ankles , her pain groaning against the heavy noise of the engine .	mother
While she was talking [MASK] wondered why Jove wanted me .	I
[MASK] had come out dressed to kill and I was the one being murdered .	I
My [MASK] is a jigsaw I can not complete .	self-esteem
[MASK] get one part of the picture and the rest lies in pieces .	I
[MASK] suspect that there is no picture , only fragments .	I
Other [MASK] seem to glue it together somehow and not to worry that they have been using pieces from several different boxes .	people
Is [MASK] a deceit , a make-shift , and should we hurry to make any pattern we can ?	identity
[MASK] would like to convince myself about myself but I can not .	I
The [MASK] there is are days when the jigsaw assumes its own meaning and I no longer care what picture is emerging .	best
By that [MASK] mean I am unfrightened by the unexpected .	I
If there is beauty [MASK] will surprise me .	it
[MASK] said I suspect that there is no picture .	I
[MASK] should have said that whatever the picture is , it will not be the one on the box .	I
[MASK] lit every one of his distress flares and burnt up the river in a blaze of phosphorous red .	He
Every tug and patrol [MASK] on the stretch surrounded us , but far from sinking we were celebrating .	boat
My [MASK] called it the Miracle of the Sardines and the Gin .	grandmother
[MASK] met Stella at the Algonquin Hotel .	I
[MASK] had stayed there because it seemed so English and when he brought me to New York for the first time as a child our reservations were at the Algonquin Hotel .	He
My [MASK] loved me because she recognised the same stubbornness that she had gened in her son .	grandmother
The [MASK] and the dream were not separate .	difficulty
[MASK] one can force you to it .	No
[MASK] one can force you away .	No
Later , much later when I heard Wagner 's Ring cycle [MASK] thought of the times when I had been a very little child and my father had taken me to watch the sunset on the estuary .	I
[MASK] loved the gold light dabbling the water .	He
His [MASK] played in it .	mind
[MASK] and his images were still free but then the moving gold hardened around him and he began to count it .	He
The [MASK] agree that in the difficulty and the dream the hero should never count the cost .	stories
On my sixth birthday the [MASK] started .	parties
[MASK] had a cake , presents , a new frock .	I
The [MASK] had what my father called a ' foie gras ' .	adults
How much can [MASK] eat and drink without vomiting over the coffee table ?	you
[MASK] said : ' Why did n't you tell me ? '	Mother
On the night of my birth my [MASK] got the madness on him and told my mother he had to go tugging .	father
' I 'll come with you , ' [MASK] said .	she
' [MASK] feel well . '	I
At the same time [MASK] realised the absurdity of pinning anything onto a kiss .	I
What patterns do the [MASK] make ?	numbers
[MASK] plus one is not necessarily two .	One
[MASK] do the sum and the answer is an incipient third .	I
[MASK] sniffed the bottles .	I
[MASK] admire the soprano singer but not the soprano speaker .	I
High [MASK] like high heels are a put-on .	voices
[MASK] had dressed as a warrior : black from cleavage to insoles , hair down , fat hoops of gold in my ears , war-paint make-up .	I
[MASK] had a twenty-year advantage over my opponent and I intended to use every month of it .	I
' What have [MASK] made of my life ? '	I
' [MASK] flirted with Mama who had a weakness for dark hair and dark eyes , even in a sevenyear-old boy . '	He
Of course [MASK] had not come .	she
Of course [MASK] would not come .	she
[MASK] had been a nerve war and I had won .	It
[MASK] noticed I had a terrible pain in my neck .	I
[MASK] ordered a drink and collapsed under a potted palm .	I
' May [MASK] sit here ? '	I
[MASK] must be English . '	You
Behind them , a [MASK] struggled up the steps with a pile of boxes .	taxi-driver
The little [MASK] had been asleep and through his dreams came a sleigh piled with furs and followed on foot by a band of wild dark men , huddled hurrying , talking in a language he did not understand .	boy
[MASK] heard barking and crying and from below the protesting water being drawn along the frozen pipes and into the geyser .	He
[MASK] woke up and ran downstairs .	He
Through the blue curtain of cold , into the orange lights , six [MASK] drew a sledge .	wolves
The leading [MASK] pulled up two inches from his chest and level with it .	pair
[MASK] of the wolves licked his face with its brown-pink parma ham tongue .	One
[MASK] had begun with Genesis and were now at the Book of Job , with whose trials my grandmother sympathised , especially since she had recently developed a boil .	They
' Are n't [MASK] polite ? '	Americans
' Only if [MASK] pay them enough . '	you
' The [MASK] are n't polite no matter how much you pay them . '	British
' Then [MASK] and I must be refugees . '	you
As she read ' Who will avail me in my tribulation ? ' the [MASK] flew open and my father reached down into the bath and scooped out my mother whole and carried her off into the bedroom .	door
My [MASK] had told me about the remoras and how the Greek fishermen in the little boats still fear him .	father
My [MASK] feared no remoras .	father
[MASK] were quiet .	We
[MASK] was looking towards the door .	She
[MASK] looked at her .	I
[MASK] was slim , wired , a greyhound body , half bent forward now , shape of her back muscles contouring her shirt , white , starched , expensive .	She
Her left [MASK] looked like the front window of Tiffany 's .	arm
[MASK] was not sure how a woman could wear so much silver and sit without a lean .	I
Her [MASK] was dark red , dogwood red , leather red with a suppleness to it that is part gift , part effort .	hair
[MASK] guessed that the look of hers was as artful as it was artless .	I
' David sha n't like it , ' [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] gathered her things and together we left the destroyed room .	She
[MASK] had to follow her as she twisted the pavements under her feet .	I
[MASK] lost sense of where we were .	I
The [MASK] had buckled .	grid
The [MASK] was a bent alley and she was the better rat .	city
' Then [MASK] shall be bad . '	I
In 1957 [MASK] married my mother .	he
[MASK] was Irish , nearly well-to-do , the daughter of a partner in the firm who was based in Cork .	She
My [MASK] had seen her at the Annual Dinner and Dance and vowed that he would marry her .	father
For two years [MASK] exchanged letters and gifts until romance , persistence and a promotion won the day .	they
On their wedding night , at the Hotel Ra-Ra ( décor : Merseyside-Egypt ) , my [MASK] took off his pyjamas so that his wife could see him man qua man , then told her that he would not make love to her until he had been made a director of the line .	father
[MASK] put on his pyjamas again and after a moment or two of violent shuddering , fell asleep .	He
[MASK] took me home , did n't put on any lights , took off her clothes and had me lie down beside her on what seemed to be a very narrow bed .	She
[MASK] wanted to touch her .	I
The reflecting [MASK] of a woman with a woman is seductive .	image
[MASK] enjoyed looking at her in a way that was forbidden to me , this self on self , self as desirer and desired , had a frankness to it I had not been invited to discover .	I
Desiring her [MASK] felt my own desirability .	I
[MASK] was an act of power but not power over her .	It
[MASK] was my own conquest .	I
[MASK] and waited on blew in rags out of the door .	Waiters
[MASK] looked at her watch .	She
' Are [MASK] staying here ? '	you
' No . [MASK] live in New York .	I
[MASK] work at the Institute for Advanced Studies .	I
[MASK] came here to meet ... '	I
The [MASK] says that Zeus lusted after a Titan called Metis and eventually got her with a child .	legend
An [MASK] told Zeus that the baby would be a girl but that if Metis ever conceived again , she would wear a boy who would overthrough Zeus , just as Zeus had deposed his own father , Kronos .	oracle
In fear , [MASK] stroked and flattered Metis until she came close enough to kiss him of her own free will .	Zeus
[MASK] swallowed her .	He
' I 'll teach you , ' [MASK] said .	she
My [MASK] pleased with his work , my mother pleased with her home and her children .	father
[MASK] do n't remember the exact moment of the eclipse , only a gradual chilliness and the golden light paling yellow-pale-yellow-yellow to fade .	I
[MASK] do remember that my father felt cheated .	I
His [MASK] was insufficient , his bonus was insufficient , his challenges were puny , his achievements were not fully recognised .	salary
[MASK] said those things to my mother , I heard them , but to me he said , by the sun-dial , ' I 'm forty-one and the sea is dying . '	He
[MASK] ran his finger back and forth over the hooded Time .	He
When he arrived home my [MASK] was not expecting him .	mother
His [MASK] had not made the instructed call .	secretary
[MASK] was in the bath , with bubbles up to her neck , and my grandmother , on the bath-stool , was reading out loud from the Bible .	Mother
[MASK] was their regular Sunday visiting hour , and having little in common and less to say , they had hit on the happy idea of spiritual elevation .	This
My [MASK] never listened to what my grandmother read , but she felt she was doing her duty by her family and by God , and it saved her the trouble of going to church .	mother
My [MASK] , who was firmly convinced by the Word of the Lord , took more pleasure in that hour than in any other of the week , including 2 p.m. Thursday when she drew her pension .	grandmother

Extensible Markup [MASK] ( XML ) is the standard language for describing and delivering data on the Web , just as Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is the standard language for creating and displaying Web pages .	Language
[MASK] Access provides ways to both import and export XML data as well as transform the data to and from other formats using XML related files .	Microsoft
[MASK] describes how a Web page should look , whereas XML defines the data and describes how the data should be structured .	HTML
[MASK] is a data interchange format in that it allows you to exchange data between dissimilar systems or applications .	XML
[MASK] separates the data from the presentation so that the same XML data can be presented in multiple ways by using different presentation files .	XML
[MASK] is a standards-based protocol that is governed by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .	XML
The XML [MASK] is a set of rules , guidelines , and conventions for designing data formats and structures , in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and easily read by different computers and applications .	protocol
In addition , XML defined [MASK] are unambiguous ; that is , they are self-describing and platform-independent .	structures
Like HTML , [MASK] makes use of tags and attributes , but while HTML specifies what each tag and attribute means ( and thus how the data between them will look in a browser ) , XML uses the tags only to delimit pieces of data , and leaves the interpretation of the data completely to the application that reads it .	XML
[MASK] provides choices for using data from many external sources .	Access
[MASK] makes it easier to transform the data from almost any external application for use by Access .	XML
[MASK] can :	You
[MASK] can use the Import command ( point to Get External Data on the File menu ) to import XML data files into Access .	You
This [MASK] displays the Import dialog box so that you can select an XML document as well as a schema , which describes the structure of the data .	command
[MASK] can only import a single document at a time into Access .	You
The [MASK] must be in a format that Access recognizes , either in a native format or through the use of a schema .	data
[MASK] can transform the native XML data into a specific Access format by choosing from the options in the Import XML dialog box .	You
[MASK] can also specify whether to overwrite any existing tables or append to existing data .	You
[MASK] use XML schemas to describe the structure of data in a common format that customers , other Web browsers , and any number of XML-enabled software programs can recognize .	You
Specifically , [MASK] define the rules of an XML data document , including element names and data types , which elements can appear in combination , and which attributes are available for each element .	schemas
[MASK] provide a model for an XML data document which defines the arrangement of tags and text within all documents referencing the schema .	Schemas
[MASK] supports the XML Schema standard ( XSD ) .	Access
[MASK] is a proposed World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) standard designed as a basic infrastructure for describing the type and structure of XML documents .	XSD
By using a schema , [MASK] can ensure that any XML document that is used to import data into Access or export from Access to another format contains specific data and conforms to a defined structure .	you
[MASK] can also provide the schema to other businesses and applications so that they know how they should structure any data they provide to you and they , in turn , can provide their schema to you .	You
XML [MASK] ( the tags and their placement in a document ) defines and describes the data in an XML document but does n't indicate how the data should be displayed .	syntax
However , a [MASK] is n't always a good choice because they are written in a specialized language which means that the developer has to use another language in order to write , modify , or understand the structure of the style sheet .	CSS
A [MASK] merely allows you to specify the formatting of each XML element without much control over the output .	CSS
On the other hand , an Extensible Stylesheet Language ( XSL ) style [MASK] is considerably more flexible than a CSS file .	sheet
[MASK] allows you to precisely select the data that will be displayed , to specify the order or arrangement of the data , and to modify or add information .	It
[MASK] can apply a filter to a row or column field to show the top or bottom n items based on a total .	You
For example , [MASK] can filter for the top or bottom 25 % of salespeople based on the number of orders handled .	you
[MASK] are additive .	Filters
Conditional [MASK] are independent of each other .	filters
The [MASK] of one conditional filter does not affect the result of another .	result
For example , if you set a conditional filter to show the top two cities based on sales , followed by an autofilter on the ShippedCity field to include only five cities , the PivotTable [MASK] will show the top two of the five cities you selected .	view
When items in a field are hidden by autofiltering or filter by selection , the drop-down arrow Field [MASK] in the field label is blue .	arrow
When items in a field are hidden by conditional filtering , a [MASK] appears to the left of the drop-down arrow Field arrow .	funnel
[MASK] can get more information about the current filter in the Properties dialog box .	You
[MASK] can include only the displayed data , or both visible and hidden data .	Totals
In Design view of a form , report , or data access page , [MASK] can format a control in the following ways :	you
[MASK] can resize a control by using the sizing handles , or you can resize a control to the height or width of another control .	You
When you are in Design view of a form or report , [MASK] can use the ruler to help you resize controls .	you
[MASK] can change the color of a control or make it transparent .	You
[MASK] can also emphasize the appearance of a control by using special effects .	You
For example , [MASK] can specify that a control is raised , sunken , or etched .	you
On a form or report , [MASK] can also specify that a control is shadowed or chiseled .	you
[MASK] can set the color and width of borders of controls .	You
Also , [MASK] can set the line style of borders . For example , you can specify that a border consists of dashes or dots .	you
[MASK] can specify the font and font size for text in a control .	You
Also , [MASK] can make the text in a control bold , italic , or underlined .	you
[MASK] can move a control or align it relative to another control .	You
[MASK] can increase or decrease the space between controls , or you can specify that controls are evenly spaced .	You
[MASK] can change property settings for a group of controls of the same type or for a group of controls of different types .	You
If you select controls of different types , [MASK] Access displays only the properties that are shared by the group in the property sheet .	Microsoft
If all the controls that you 've selected share the same property setting , that [MASK] appears in the property sheet ; otherwise , that property box is blank .	setting
To select several controls at once in a data access page , [MASK] must have Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 installed on your computer .	you
In a form or report , the Name [MASK] never appears when more than one control is selected because control names must be unique .	property
[MASK] can group items by specifying the type of interval and the size of the interval .	You
For example , [MASK] can group a field with date values into different months , and specify the interval as 2 , to create groups such as Jan-Feb , Mar-Apr , and so on .	you
The [MASK] of interval you can specify for a field depends on the data type of the field .	type
[MASK] can group in intervals of any integer , such as 1 , 2 , 5 , 100 , and so on . For example , you can group the EmployeeID field into groups of 1-100 , 101-200 , and so on .	You
[MASK] can group in intervals such as days , weeks , and quarters .	You
For example , [MASK] can group the values in the ShippedDate field into months to show data for orders shipped in January , orders shipped in February , and so on .	you
[MASK] wondered if the young Auster had been any better at it than he was .	He
The [MASK] that month showed a street in some New England fishing village , perhaps Nantucket .	scene
A beautiful spring [MASK] shone on the cobblestones , flowers of many colors stood in window boxes along the house fronts , and far down at the end of the street was the ocean , with its white waves and blue , blue water .	light
[MASK] remembered visiting Nantucket with his wife long ago , in her first month of pregnancy , when his son was no more than a tiny almond in her belly .	Quinn
[MASK] found it painful to think of that now , and he tried to suppress the pictures that were forming in his head .	He
Look at it through Auster 's eyes , [MASK] said to himself , and do n't think of anything else .	he
[MASK] turned his attention to the photograph again and was relieved to find his thoughts wandering to the subject of whales , to the expeditions that had set out from Nantucket in the last century , to Melville and the opening pages of Moby Dick .	He
From there his [MASK] drifted off to the accounts he had read of Melville 's last years – the taciturn old man working in the New York customs house , with no readers , forgotten by everyone .	mind
Then , suddenly , with great clarity and precision , [MASK] saw Bartleby 's window and the blank brick wall before him .	he
[MASK] tapped him on the arm , and as Quinn wheeled to meet the assault , he saw a short , silent man holding out a green and red ballpoint pen to him .	Someone
[MASK] reached into his pocket and gave the man a dollar .	Quinn
The deaf [MASK] nodded once very briefly and then moved on , leaving Quinn with the pen in his hand .	mute
[MASK] was now past five o'clock .	It
[MASK] decided he would be less vulnerable in another spot and removed himself to the waiting room .	Quinn
[MASK] was generally a grim place , filled with dust and people with nowhere to go , but now , with the rush hour at full force , it had been taken over by men and women with briefcases , books , and newspapers .	This
[MASK] had trouble finding a seat .	Quinn
After searching for two or three minutes , [MASK] finally found a place on one of the benches , wedging himself between a man in a blue suit and a plump young woman .	he
The [MASK] was reading the sports section of the Times , and Quinn glanced over to read the account of Mets ' loss the night before .	man
[MASK] had made it to the third or fourth paragraph when the man turned slowly toward him , gave him a vicious stare , and jerked the paper out of view .	He
After that , a strange [MASK] happened .	thing
[MASK] turned his attention to the young woman on his right , to see if there was any reading material in that direction .	Quinn
[MASK] guessed her age at around twenty .	Quinn
[MASK] was , however , reading a book , a paperback with a lurid cover , and Quinn leaned over ever so slightly to his right to catch a glimpse of the title .	She
Against all his expectations , [MASK] was a book he himself had written – Suicide Squeeze by William Wilson , the first of the Max Work novels .	it
[MASK] had often imagined this situation : the sudden , unexpected pleasure of encountering one of his readers .	Quinn
[MASK] had even imagined the conversation that would follow : he , suavely diffident as the stranger praised the book , and then , with great reluctance and modesty , agreeing to autograph the title page , since you insist .	He
But now that the scene was taking place , [MASK] felt quite disappointed , even angry .	he
[MASK] did not like the girl sitting next to him , and it offended him that she should be casually skimming the pages that had cost him so much effort .	He
His [MASK] was to tear the book out of her hands and run across the station with it .	impulse
[MASK] looked at her face again , trying to hear the words she was sounding out in her head , watching her eyes as they darted back and forth across the page .	He
[MASK] must have been looking too hard , for a moment later she turned to him with an irritated expression on her face and said , You got a problem , mister ?	He
[MASK] smiled weakly . No problem , he said .	Quinn
[MASK] was just wondering if you liked the book .	I
The [MASK] shrugged . I 've read better and I 've read worse .	girl
[MASK] wanted to drop the conversation right there , but something in him persisted .	Quinn
Before he could get up and leave , the [MASK] were already out of his mouth . Do you find it exciting ?	words
The [MASK] shrugged again and cracked her gum loudly . Sort of . There 's a part where the detective gets lost that 's kind of scary .	girl
Is [MASK] a smart detective ?	he
Yeah , [MASK] 's smart . But he talks too much .	he
[MASK] 'd like more action ?	You
[MASK] guess so .	I
If you do n't like it , why do [MASK] go on reading ?	you
[MASK] do n't know . The girl shrugged once again .	I
[MASK] passes the time , I guess .	It
Anyway , [MASK] 's no big deal . It 's just a book .	it
[MASK] was about to tell her who he was , but then he realized that it made no difference .	He
The [MASK] was beyond hope .	girl
For five years [MASK] had kept William Wilson 's identity a secret , and he was n't about to give it away now , least of all to an imbecile stranger .	he
Still , [MASK] was painful , and he struggled desperately to swallow his pride .	it
Rather than punch the girl in the face , [MASK] abruptly stood up from his seat and walked away .	he
At six-thirty [MASK] posted himself in front of gate twenty-four .	he
The [MASK] was due to arrive in time , and from his vantage in the center of the doorway , Quinn judged that his chances of seeing Stillman were good .	train
[MASK] took out the photograph from his pocket and studied it again ,	He
[MASK] remembered having read somewhere that the eyes were the one feature of the face that never changed .	He
From childhood to old age [MASK] remained the same , and a man with the head to see it could theoretically look into the eyes of a boy in a photograph and recognize the same person as an old man .	they
[MASK] had his doubts , but this was all he had to go on , his only bridge to the present .	Quinn
Once again , however , Stillman 's [MASK] told him nothing .	face
The [MASK] pulled into the station , and Quinn felt the noise of it shoot through his body : a random , hectic din that seemed to join with his pulse , pumping his blood in raucous spurts .	train
His [MASK] then filled with Peter Stillman 's voice , as a barrage of nonsense words clattered against the walls of his skull .	head
[MASK] told himself to stay calm .	He
But [MASK] did little good . In spite of what he had been expecting of himself at this moment , he was excited .	that
The [MASK] was crowded , and as the passengers started filling the ramp and walking toward him , they quickly became a mob .	train
[MASK] flapped the red notebook nervously against his right thigh , stood on his tiptoes , and peered into the throng .	Quinn
Soon the [MASK] were surging around him .	people
[MASK] watched them all , anchored to his spot , as if his whole being had been exiled to his eyes .	Quinn
Each time an elderly man approached , [MASK] braced himself for it to be Stillman .	he
[MASK] came and went too quickly for him to indulge in disappointment , but in each old face he seemed to find an augur of what the real Stillman would be like , and he rapidly shifted his expectations with each new face , as if the accumulation of old men was heralding the imminent arrival of Stillman himself .	They
For one brief instant [MASK] thought , So this is what detective work is like . But other than that he thought nothing .	Quinn
[MASK] watched .	He
Immobile among the moving crowd , [MASK] stood there and watched .	he
The next morning , and for many mornings to follow , [MASK] posted himself on a bench in the middle of the traffic island at Broadway and 99th Street .	Quinn
[MASK] wish it was . But this has nothing to do with literature .	I
[MASK] paused , looked around the room without seeing anything , and tried to start .	Quinn
[MASK] 've a feeling there 's been a terrible mistake .	I
[MASK] came here looking for Paul Auster , the private detective .	I
The what ? [MASK] laughed , and in that laugh everything was suddenly blown to bits .	Auster
[MASK] realized that he was talking nonsense .	Quinn
[MASK] must just as well have asked for Chief Sitting Bull – the effect would have been no different .	He
The private detective , [MASK] repeated softly .	he
[MASK] 'm afraid you 've got the wrong Paul Auster .	I
[MASK] 're the only one in the book .	You
But [MASK] 'm not a detective .	I
What do [MASK] do ?	you
[MASK] 'm a writer .	I
I 'm sorry . [MASK] said .	Auster
But that 's what [MASK] happen to be .	I
The whole [MASK] is a bad dream .	thing
[MASK] have no idea what you 're talking about .	I
[MASK] told him .	Quinn
[MASK] began at the beginning and went through the entire story , step by step .	He
The [MASK] had been building up in him since Stillman 's disappearance that morning , and it came out of him now as a torrent of words .	pressure
[MASK] told of the phone calls for Paul Auster , of his inexplicable acceptance of the case , of his meeting with Peter Stillman , of his conversation with Virginia Stillman , of his reading Stillman 's book , of his following Stillman from Grand Central Station , of Stillman 's daily wanderings , of the carpetbag and the broken objects , of the disquieting maps that formed letters of the alphabet , of his talks with Stillman , of Stillman 's disappearance from the hotel .	He
When he had come to the end , [MASK] said , Do you think I 'm crazy ?	he
If I had been in your place , [MASK] probably would have done the same thing .	I
These [MASK] came as a great relief to Quinn , as if , at long last , the burden was no longer his alone .	words
[MASK] felt like taking Auster in his arms and declaring his friendship for life .	He
[MASK] took out his wallet and removed the five-hundred-dollar check that Virginia Stillman had written two weeks earlier .	He
[MASK] handed it to Auster . You see , he said .	He
[MASK] looked the check over carefully and nodded .	Auster
[MASK] seems to be a perfectly normal check .	It
[MASK] want you to have it .	I
[MASK] could n't possibly accept it .	I
[MASK] 's of no use to me . Quinn looked around the apartment and gestured vaguely .	It
[MASK] is money you 've earned .	This
[MASK] deserve to have it yourself . Auster paused for a moment .	You
Since the check is in my name , [MASK] 'll cash it for you .	I
[MASK] 'll take it to my bank tomorrow morning , deposit it in my account , and give you the money when it clears .	I
[MASK] did not say anything .	Quinn
All right ? [MASK] asked .	Auster
[MASK] 'll see what happens .	We
[MASK] put the check on the coffee table , as if to say the matter had been settled .	Auster
Then [MASK] leaned back on the sofa and looked Quinn in the eyes .	he
There 's a much more important question than the check , [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] do n't understand it at all .	I
[MASK] wonder if you 've had any trouble with your phone lately .	I
[MASK] sometimes get crossed . A person tries to call a number , and even though he dials correctly , he gets someone else .	Wires
Yes , [MASK] 's happened to me before .	that
But even if my phone was broken , [MASK] does n't explain the real problem .	that
[MASK] would tell us why the call went to you , but not why they wanted to speak to me in the first place .	It
[MASK] 've never heard of the Stillmans .	I
Maybe [MASK] wanted to play a practical joke on you .	someone
[MASK] do n't hang around with people like that .	I
[MASK] never know .	You
But the fact is , [MASK] 's not a joke .	it
[MASK] 's a real case with real people .	It
[MASK] 'm aware of that .	I
[MASK] had come to the end of what they could talk about .	They
[MASK] realized that he should be going .	Quinn
[MASK] had been there almost an hour , and the time was approaching for his call to Virginia Stillman .	He
Nevertheless , [MASK] was reluctant to move .	he
The [MASK] was comfortable , and the beer had gone slightly to his head .	chair
This [MASK] was the first intelligent person he had spoken to in a long time .	Auster
[MASK] had read Quinn 's old work , he had admired it , he had been looking forward to more .	He
The [MASK] is really very handsome , with his full cheeks , his long clear dark-green eyes , and the short strong beard .	Archbishop
His [MASK] is venerable rich and beautiful .	church

The antique [MASK] are gorgeous .	tiles
But all these [MASK] are in some way external .	things
[MASK] outsiders are not stable enough to appreciate them .	We
[MASK] inherit our mode of appreciation from the Victorians , from a time of safety and leisure , when dinner guests knew better than to smoke after the main course , when Levantines were Levantines and culture was still culture .	We
[MASK] soon get around to contemporary matters .	We
the [MASK] excuses himself in two languages and tells us when he comes back that he has been speaking to one of his Lebanese friends calling from Cyprus or from Greece .	Archbishop

The [MASK] are in disarray , perhaps in retreat .	Russians
[MASK] have been hearing conversations like this one for half a century .	I
[MASK] well remember what intelligent , informed people were saying in the last years of the Weimar Republic , what they told one another in the first days after Hindenburg had brought in Hitler .	I
[MASK] recall table talk from the times of Leon Blum and Edouard Daladier .	I
[MASK] remember what people said about the Italian adventure in Ethiopia and about the Spanish Civil War and the Battle of Britain .	I
Such intelligent [MASK] has n't always been wrong .	discussion
What is [MASK] with it is that the discussants invariably impart their own intelligence to what they are discussing .	wrong
Later , historical [MASK] show that what actually happened was devoid of anything like such intelligence .	studies

In my letter to Le Monde [MASK] had said that in the French tradition there were two attitudes toward the Jews : a revolutionary attitude which had resulted in their enfranchisement , and an anti-Semitic one .	I
The intellectual [MASK] of the Enlightenment were decidedly anti-Semitic .	leaders
[MASK] asked which of the two attitudes would prevail in twentieth-century France the century of the Dreyfus affair and of the Vichy government .	I
The position taken by Foreign Minister Maurice Jobert in the October War of 1973 was that the Palestinian [MASK] had a natural and justified desire to " go home . "	Arabs
[MASK] expressed , politely , the hope that the other attitude , the revolutionary one , would not be abandoned .	I

" Why are [MASK] so kind to me ? " Dostoevski asks .	you
And the [MASK] , speaking to one of the geniuses of the nineteenth century , answers , " Because you are so simple that one can not help feeling sorry for you . "	murderer
Even when he robbed Dostoevski , [MASK] pitied him as one might " a little cherub-like child . "	he
[MASK] , exceedingly intelligent but , to a Westerner , curiously deformed ( how could an independent intellectual in the Soviet Union escape deformity ? ) , sees us , the Americans , as children at whom the Stalins smile through their mustachios .	Navrozov
[MASK] were arriving , and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them .	People
The old [MASK] sat on her chair .	one
[MASK] wore a starched white affair on her head , had a wart on one cheek , and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose .	She
[MASK] glanced at me above the glasses .	She
The swift and indifferent [MASK] of that look troubled me .	placidity
[MASK] seemed to know all about them and about me too .	She
An eerie [MASK] came over me .	feeling
[MASK] seemed uncanny and fateful .	She
Often far away there [MASK] thought of these two , guarding the door of Darkness , knitting black wool as for a warm pall , one introducing , introducing continuously to the unknown , the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes .	I
Not [MASK] of those she looked at ever saw her again – not half , by a long way .	many
Accordingly a young [MASK] wearing his hat over the left eyebrow , some clerk I suppose , – there must have been clerks in the business , though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead , – came from somewhere up-stairs , and led me forth .	chap
[MASK] was shabby and careless , with ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket , and his cravat was large and billowy , under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot .	He
[MASK] was a little too early for the doctor , so I proposed a drink , and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality . As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company 's business , and by-and-by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there .	It
[MASK] became very cool and collected all at once .	He
I am not such a fool as I look , quoth Plato to his disciples , [MASK] said sententiously , emptied his glass with great resolution , and we rose .	he
The old [MASK] felt my pulse , evidently thinking of something else the while .	doctor
Good , good for there , [MASK] mumbled , and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head .	he
Rather surprised , [MASK] said Yes , when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way , taking notes carefully .	I
[MASK] was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine , with his feet in slippers , and I thought him a harmless fool .	He
I always ask leave , in the interests of science , to measure the crania of those going out there , [MASK] said .	he
Oh , [MASK] never see them , he remarked ; ' and , moreover , the changes take place inside , you know .	I
[MASK] smiled , as if at some quiet joke .	He
So [MASK] are going out there .	you
[MASK] gave me a searching glance , and made another note .	He
Ever any madness in your family ? ' [MASK] asked , in a matter-of-fact tone .	he
[MASK] felt very annoyed .	I
Are you an alienist ? [MASK] interrupted .	I
' [MASK] have a little theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help me to prove .	I
[MASK] is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency .	This
The mere wealth [MASK] leave to others .	I
' [MASK] hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical .	I
What you say is rather profound , and probably erroneous , [MASK] said , with a laugh .	he
How do [MASK] English say , eh ? Good-by .	you
In the tropics [MASK] must before everything keep calm .	one
' ... [MASK] lifted a warning forefinger ... .	He
One [MASK] more remained to do – say good-by to my excellent aunt .	thing
[MASK] found her triumphant .	I
[MASK] had a cup of tea – the last decent cup of tea for many days – and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady 's drawing-room to look , we had a long quiet chat by the fireside .	I
and [MASK] was going to take charge of a two-penny-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached !	I
There had been a [MASK] of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time , and the excellent woman , living right in the rush of all that humbug , got carried off her feet .	lot
[MASK] talked about ' weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways ' , till , upon my word , she made me quite uncomfortable .	She
Another [MASK] on the cliff went off , followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet .	mine
The [MASK] was going on .	work
And [MASK] was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die .	this
[MASK] were dying slowly – it was very clear .	They
[MASK] were not enemies , they were not criminals , they were nothing earthly now , – nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation , lying confusedly in the greenish gloom .	They
Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts , lost in uncongenial surroundings , fed on unfamiliar food , [MASK] sickened , became inefficient , and were then allowed to crawl away and rest .	they
These moribund [MASK] were free as air – and nearly as thin .	shapes
[MASK] began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees .	I
Then , glancing down , [MASK] saw a face near my hand .	I
The black [MASK] reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree , and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me , enormous and vacant , a kind of blind , white flicker in the depths of the orbs , which died out slowly .	bones
The [MASK] seemed young – almost a boy – but you know with them it 's hard to tell .	man
[MASK] found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede 's ship 's biscuits I had in my pocket .	I
The [MASK] closed slowly on it and held – there was no other movement and no other glance .	fingers
[MASK] had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck – Why ?	He
Where did [MASK] get it ?	he
Was [MASK] a badge – an ornament – a charm – a propitiatory act ?	it
[MASK] looked startling round his black neck , this bit of white thread from beyond the seas .	It
Near the same tree two more [MASK] of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up .	bundles
While I stood horror-struck , [MASK] of these creatures rose to his hands and knees , and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink .	one
[MASK] lapped out of his hand , then sat up in the sunlight , crossing his shins in front of him , and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone .	He
[MASK] did n't want any more loitering in the shade , and I made haste towards the station .	I
When near the buildings [MASK] met a white man , in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision .	I
[MASK] saw a high starched collar , white cuffs , a light alpaca jacket , snowy trousers , a clear necktie , and varnished boots . No hat .	I
[MASK] was amazing , and had a penholder behind his ear .	He
[MASK] shook hands with this miracle , and I learned he was the Company 's chief accountant , and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station .	I
[MASK] had come out for a moment , he said , ' to get a breath of fresh air . '	He
The [MASK] sounded wonderfully odd , with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life .	expression
[MASK] would n't have mentioned the fellow to you at all , only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time .	I
Moreover , [MASK] respected the fellow .	I
Yes ; [MASK] respected his collars , his vast cuffs , his brushed hair .	I
His [MASK] was certainly that of a hairdresser 's dummy ; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance .	appearance
[MASK] 's backbone .	That
His starched [MASK] and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character .	collars
[MASK] had been out nearly three years ; and , later on , I could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen .	He
[MASK] had just the faintest blush , and said modestly , I 've been teaching one of the native women about the station .	He
[MASK] was difficult . She had a distaste for the work .	It
This [MASK] had verily accomplished something .	man
[MASK] else in the station was in a muddle , – heads , things , buildings .	Everything
[MASK] of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed ; a stream of manufactured goods , rubbishy cottons , beads , and brass-wire set into the depths of darkness , and in return came a precious trickle of ivory .	Strings
[MASK] had to wait in the station for ten days – an eternity .	I
[MASK] lived in a hut in the yard , but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant 's office .	I
[MASK] was hot there too ; big flies buzzed fiendishly , and did not sting , but stabbed .	It
[MASK] sat generally on the floor , while , of faultless appearance ( and even slightly scented ) , perching on a high stool , he wrote , he wrote .	I
Sometimes [MASK] stood up for exercise .	he
When a truckle-bed with a sick man ( some invalided agent from up-country ) was put in there , [MASK] exhibited a gentle annoyance .	he
The groans of this sick person , [MASK] said , distract my attention .	he
And without that [MASK] is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate .	it
One day [MASK] remarked , without lifting his head , ' In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz . '	he
On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was , [MASK] said he was a first-class agent ; and seeing my disappointment at this information , he added slowly , laying down his pen , ' He is a very remarkable person . '	he
Further [MASK] elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading post , a very important one , in the true ivory-country , at ' the very bottom of there .	questions
[MASK] began to write again .	He
The sick [MASK] was too ill to groan .	man
The [MASK] buzzed in a great peace .	flies
[MASK] would certainly be counterproductive to make an offer , as some have already tried , when the Russians want nothing to do with it .	It
In our proposals in relation to Agenda 2000 [MASK] considered the probable future trend of competition between pigmeat and beef .	we
Should we find at any point that this is not the case , [MASK] will take the appropriate steps .	we
[MASK] must admit I see the question of a world market orientation rather differently from the way it was presented a moment ago .	I
[MASK] favour a reform involving the alignment of prices to world market prices and a reduction in export refunds .	We
Finally , [MASK] should like to point out here the significance of a proposal put forward by our colleague Edouard des Places .	I
[MASK] see this proposal as establishing some sort of precedent .	I
[MASK] need foreign investors in places such as Telford , north Shropshire , Hereford , Ross-on-Wye and Wyre Forest .	We
[MASK] would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be penalised .	I
The 2.6 -% [MASK] of fluctuation is nothing new ; it already exists within the present system and is already being applied .	margin
The flat-rate [MASK] produces more risk of overcompensation , which is why we have set the margin at 2.6 -% .	approach
A strong [MASK] will therefore penalise European agricultural exports .	euro
Under these conditions , what will the [MASK] of the rural areas of Europe be like as a consequence ?	future
[MASK] in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feel that this form of production should be encouraged .	We
[MASK] have nothing against putting quality goods on the world market when it is a matter of competition .	I
Firstly , [MASK] proposes the adoption of a regulation improving the transparency and authenticity of quality marks .	it
[MASK] then proposes the creation of a European quality mark based on respect for the environmental criteria for production .	It
[MASK] in Parliament would like to add a third category covering organic products that also comply with environmental and animal protection criteria .	We
[MASK] was recently in Poland for the Joint Parliamentary Committee .	I
[MASK] support the introduction of a European quality mark , which takes account of animal welfare and the environment .	We
Secondly , [MASK] can not support proposals for the split in funding or criteria in relation to the new Structural Fund regulation .	we
[MASK] welcome the introduction of conditional clauses for the second payment .	We
The [MASK] of the fourth phase of the Objective 2 programme , whose priority is job creation , are relatively pleasing .	results
Mr [MASK] Hernando is speaking for the first time in this House .	Escola
Mr President , [MASK] should merely like to answer Mr Kellett-Bowman in one sentence .	I
The [MASK] has already stated that the proposal was made in accordance with the Rules , so there are no grounds for changing anything .	Chair
Our [MASK] has tabled several amendments in this direction .	group
The [MASK] has also contributed to the activities of 50000 creative or performing artists and other specialists in the cultural sector .	programme
[MASK] concludes Parliament 's agenda .	That
Yesterday [MASK] was my privilege and pleasure to be permitted two minutes ' speaking time in this House .	it
[MASK] is wrong .	That
The [MASK] expires today , so if we do not vote , we shall miss the opportunity to deliver our opinion .	deadline
[MASK] believe that the Commission 's initial approach was wise , because the problem calls for countless exceptions to the general rule .	I
Madam President , our [MASK] , Mr Cox , has done some excellent work on the Commission 's proposal .	colleague
The Green [MASK] fully agrees with Mr Spencer that we must preserve this proposal for a CO2 tax .	Group
The [MASK] will end up in the German Treasury instead of the Danish Treasury .	taxes
Nonetheless , [MASK] should like to take up two points which are mentioned in the Environment Committee 's report .	I
[MASK] should also like to know how you view the timing .	I
[MASK] is legislation requiring a unanimous vote in the Council , which is usually a guarantee of inaction .	This
In light of this situation , [MASK] find it difficult to accept a number of unilateral proposals that were put forward .	we
[MASK] is therefore unacceptable to compel the Member States to apply increases that are actually above the rate of inflation .	It
[MASK] can regulate the market , but you can not regulate nature , the weather and the harvest .	You
Nevertheless , [MASK] want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations .	we
[MASK] will therefore understand why I am rejecting them .	Everyone
[MASK] would like to start with the Convention on third-country nationals , which is certainly the more complex legislative project .	I
The mere [MASK] of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights .	offer
Secondly , [MASK] believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example .	I
On the other hand , these initial [MASK] should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished .	criteria
Such a [MASK] is unacceptable .	situation
[MASK] am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions .	I
[MASK] must help them to improve their border security .	We
Finally , [MASK] should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture .	I
[MASK] would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group .	I
[MASK] want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control .	We
[MASK] has consistently linked immigration with unemployment , insecurity and criminality , as if evil always comes from elsewhere .	He
[MASK] would really like to know how you can escape into Europe .	I
[MASK] have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament .	We
[MASK] hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do .	I
Consequently , [MASK] had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament .	I
Naturally the [MASK] will do its best to ensure that progress is made .	Commission
[MASK] thought it appropriate to retable at second reading three of the 12 amendments rejected by the Council .	I
[MASK] have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive .	I
Perhaps [MASK] are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached .	we
[MASK] are still on our agenda in the EU .	Chemicals
Thank goodness [MASK] have finally reached the last stage before adoption .	we
[MASK] agreed to urgent procedure for 22 March	Parliament
[MASK] leave space and gaps to fill in .	They
[MASK] include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .	They
[MASK] shall not go into details on the High Representative , as his or her function has already been extensively debated .	I
Finally , now that I am discussing resources , new technologies and speaking time , my own speaking [MASK] has elapsed .	time
The second [MASK] makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared .	part
The [MASK] is also imprudent in introducing issues not included in the mandate given by the Conference of Presidents .	report
But [MASK] is not really my problem .	that
[MASK] is the last rule in our Rules of Procedure and it concerns the annexes .	This
Notwithstanding this , [MASK] shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group .	we
The [MASK] concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only .	first
The second [MASK] is that of incentives .	issue
[MASK] believe it is workable , though it may be somewhat complicated .	I
[MASK] am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals .	I
[MASK] support Professor Cabrol 's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us .	We
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the present [MASK] for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed .	proposal
of course [MASK] can do so directly through support for research , and we shall continue to do so in future .	we
But [MASK] also want to create a range of additional incentives , for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right .	we
The Member [MASK] would have to do so .	States
[MASK] am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee , during the debate .	I
But then [MASK] must remember the aim of our proposal .	you
[MASK] is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult .	That
[MASK] believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on .	We
The stale cool [MASK] of the room had heated ; yet weariness receded , his head was left high and dry of it .	air
A [MASK] separated , wound nearer , there was the starting up of a hiss ( a hose , he thought ) and he made out a word : not just as a particular combination of articulated sounds , but a meaning :	voice

The [MASK] in the garden was burning , dazzling , seizing .	sun
In the bathroom [MASK] were buzzing themselves to death against the windowpanes .	flies

The [MASK] of the lavatory drizzled into the pan constantly and could n't be flushed properly , and the towels were stiff as a dress-shirt ( Olivia had taken years to get people to learn to rinse the soap out of the washing ) , but an old fellow in a cook 's hat put tea under the trees for him and carried off his crumpled suit to be pressed without being asked .	cistern
A [MASK] was cutting the tough grass with a length of iron bent at the end .	youth
Coarse and florid [MASK] , hibiscus with its big flowers sluttish with pollen and ants and poinsettia oozing milky secretion , bloomed giving a show of fecundity to the red , poor soil running baked bald under the grass , beaten slimy by the rains under the trees , and friable only where ants had digested it and made little crusty tunnels .	shrubs
A rich [MASK] of dead animal rose self-dispersed , like a gas , every now and then as he drank his tea , and he got up and looked around , as he had done so many times before , and with as little success , to see if a rat or mole were rotting somewhere .	stink
[MASK] it was could never be found ; it was the smell of growth , they had long ago decided , at Gala , the process of decay and regeneration so accelerated , brought so close together that it produced the reek of death-and-life , all at once .	Whatever
[MASK] strolled to the limits of the garden and climbed through the barbed-wire fence , but the grasses and thornbush on the other side ( Dando 's place was eight miles out of town ) were too entangled for walking where there was no path .	He
[MASK] listened to the bush and had the old feeling , in the bush , of being listened for .	He
[MASK] walked a hundred yards or so up the road , and , meeting a man on a bicycle , greeted him in the language that had come back to him as he lay in the room .	He
At six [MASK] Dando came home .	Roland
[MASK] gazed anxiously from the car as if , despite the telephone call , he were not sure if Bray had been safely received , but once he set eyes on him behaved as if they had seen each other a week ago .	He
[MASK] was indiscreet , like many people who live alone , and brought back with him from the town – a child bulging with favours from a party – all the anecdotes and gossip of the Independence celebrations , producing , in a clinging fluff of supposition and rumour , bits and pieces of real information and opinion about Mweta 's position and the sort of team he had gathered around him .	He
Another [MASK] came out under the trees , this time with whisky and gin .	tray
An old black [MASK] with corns on his elbows stood slowly swinging his tail before Dando as he talked .	Labrador
[MASK] would n't bring home any golden fleece , believe you me ( Jason Malenga was the new Minister of Finance ) ; no , it was n't a bad thing that the British Chief of Police was n't being kept on , people always judged by the Congo , the idiots , but the African deputy , Aaron Onabu , was perfectly capable of taking over from that dodderer anyway ; Talisman Gwenzi was first class , and a real Mweta man , David Sambata was an unknown quantity for Agriculture	Jason
[MASK] pulled ticks off the dog 's neck and burst them under his shoe while he drank and dealt out judgements .	Dando
Out of a kind of jealousy of the new young men from Britain and America who were so careful to show their lack of colour-feeling by avoiding tainted words and addressing people by polite forms , [MASK] ecklessly used the old settler vocabulary that reflected an attitude he had had no part of , ever .	he
[MASK] Dando could say what he liked :	Roly
[MASK] Dando had n't discovered the blacks as his fellows only yesterday .	Roly
Of course , [MASK] has to hand out a job to everybody .	Mweta
[MASK] 're all heroes , you know , heroes of the struggle .	They
[MASK] Shinza 's one of the few who did his stretch and got his head split open that time by Her Majesty 's brave boys , and where 's he ... back in the Bashi Flats among his old wives , for all I know , no one even mentions his name .	Edward
But [MASK] 's here for the Independence ceremony ?	Shinza
[MASK] glared .	Roly
[MASK] gives a damn where he is .	Nobody
But [MASK] is in town , now ?	he
[MASK] do n't know where the hell he may be .	I
[MASK] mean Edward 's not going to take part in the celebrations ?	You
[MASK] 's not possible .	That
[MASK] 's not come up to town ?	He
[MASK] can see he has n't been given a cabinet post .	You
[MASK] do n't suppose he 's going to turn up for the honour of standing in the crowd and waving a flag , eh ?	I
But [MASK] 's ridiculous , Roly .	that
[MASK] know Shinza .	You
[MASK] knows what he wants .	He
[MASK] had the impression he 'll be ambassador to U.N.	I
Of course [MASK] should have got Foreign Affairs .	he
But [MASK] 's between the two of them .	that
[MASK] might ask Mweta , if you get a chance to talk to him , ask him if he is n't going to find a piddling little job somewhere , something with a decent label to it , for poor old Shinza , he was banging on the Colonial Secretary 's door with a panga while Mweta was a snotty picannin singing hymns up at the mission school .	You
[MASK] glowered pettishly over his third or fourth gin and ginger beer .	Dando
[MASK] would drink one for several months and then switch , for similar good reasons ( it was more digestible , it was less likely to produce an after-thirst ) to another .	He
Oh [MASK] 's not like that .	Mweta
[MASK] know Mweta .	You
[MASK] know Mweta .	I
If there 's a father of the state , [MASK] 's got to be him or no one .	it
[MASK] certainly had the impression whatever tension there was had eased up , last time I saw Mweta in London .	I
[MASK] did not explain the shift of reference .	Dando
Perhaps [MASK] simply remarked upon his own getting older ;	he
undoubtedly [MASK] looked older .	he
His small [MASK] showed unexpectedly beaky now that the skin had sunk on either side .	nose
[MASK] had a lot of questions , not all of them kind , to ask about other people .	Bray
[MASK] of the answers were extraordinary ;	Some
the two [MASK] quickened to the exchange of astonishment , ironic amusement , and ( on Dando 's part ) scornful indignation with which he told and Bray learned of the swift about-face by which some white people turned a smile on the new regime , while others had already packed up and left the country .	men
Sir [MASK] himself will present Mweta with a buta-wood lectern and silver inkstand , it 's down for Tuesday afternoon .	Reginald
[MASK] was gleeful .	Dando
Sir [MASK] Harvey was president of the consortium of the three mining concessionaire companies , and it was common knowledge that , as a personal friend of Redvers Ledley , the most unpopular governor the territory had ever had , he had influenced the governor to outlaw the miners ' union at a time when Mweta and Shinza were using it to promote the independence movement .	Reginald
The People 's Independence [MASK] , at the time , had taken Harvey 's remark as an insulting reference to Mweta 's hair ; he still had it all , and it certainly would be in evidence on Tuesday .	Party
[MASK] repeated what had been said to him at the airport that morning – that some of the white people still living in the capital would be more at home down South , in Rhodesia or South Africa .	Bray
[MASK] Asahe meant the whites –	Ras

not that [MASK] ever made an effort .	they
Sheltered employment all these years , what d' [MASK] expect ?	you
[MASK] do n't need ideas , you do n't need to move out of your chair , you simply go on producing a noise out of the magic box to keep the natives quiet – and now , boom , it 's all gone , including the only incentive they ever had , their pension .	You
[MASK] 're pathetic , man ;	They
certainly [MASK] have n't much to offer when they look for jobs with the BBC .	they
[MASK] 're just not going to find any .	They
[MASK] want to go , they 're longing to , you can see they ca n't stand the sight of your face when you 're working together ... which makes things very pleasant , you can imagine ...	They
A slim little white [MASK] slipped between them and took up Ras Asahe 's hand with the gold-metal watch-bracelet as if it were some possession she had put down ...	girl
[MASK] could give you a dozen examples of the sort of thing that happens – the ceremony this afternoon : like a horse-race , man – the arrangements were exactly what they used to use for the charity Christmas Handicap , what else do they know ?	I
The [MASK] was there in their conversation like a photograph come upon lying between the pages of a book ; Bray was not sure whether she was child or woman : thin collar-bones , a long neck with a face hardly wider , pale and sallow , a big , thin , unpainted mouth , black hair and glittering , sorrowful black eyes .	girl
[MASK] wore a dress made of Congo cloth .	She
What about the golden handshake – would n't [MASK] be cheaper , in the end ?	it

[MASK] had to rise to be introduced to a big woman marking time on the edge of the dancers with the American , Curtis Pettigrew : she was a West African whom Timothy Odara had married since Bray saw him last ..	Bray
[MASK] spoke with an American intonation , too , and in her flamboyant national dress , dragged round her as if snatched straight from the brilliant bolt on a shop counter , she seemed in every way twice the size of the local African women , who were usually kept at home , and showed it .	She
[MASK] put her hand on his arm .	she
While they moved off , [MASK] said , Guess what my name is ?	she
Same as yours , [MASK] believe .	I
But [MASK] call me James .	they
[MASK] should damn well hope so .	I
Well , [MASK] 've picked someone my own size at last tonight .	I
[MASK] could just sweep the others off the floor .	We
[MASK] maintained contact all round her as they danced , talking over his shoulder to this one , putting out a broad calloused brown foot in a gold sandal to nudge that one in the calf .	She
Would [MASK] embarrass Evelyn if Evelyn sang ? she asked Bray .	it
Well , what 'd [MASK] think ?	you
What do [MASK] look as if I 'd sing ?	I
[MASK] had the self-confidence of a woman of dynamic ugliness .	She
[MASK] 've got a voice like a bullfrog .	I

In a few days the [MASK] had lost the stylized , apparition-quality of that first night , the night of the Independence Ball , and become , if not familiar , at least expected .	faces
A young [MASK] was in and out the Bayleys ' house , sometimes adding to , sometimes carrying off with her the many children who played there .	woman
[MASK] was Rebecca , Rebecca Edwards , like a big , untidy schoolgirl in her cotton shirt and sandals , the car key on her forefinger jingling harassedly .	She

[MASK] was n't listening .	Harry
[MASK] made a grab for the letters , but Dobby jumped out of reach .	He
Ah , sir , [MASK] is a danger you must not face !	this
Before Harry could move , [MASK] had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open – and sprinted down the stairs .	Dobby
Mouth dry , stomach lurching , [MASK] sprang after him , trying not to make a sound .	Harry
[MASK] jumped the last six stairs , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby .	He
[MASK] ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear .	Harry
Aunt Petunia 's [MASK] of a pudding , the mountain of cream and sugared violets , was floating up near the ceiling .	masterpiece

At first , [MASK] looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over ( Just our nephew – very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him , so we kept him upstairs )	it
[MASK] shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room , promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left , and handed him a mop .	He
Aunt [MASK] dug some ice-cream out of the freezer and Harry , still shaking , started scrubbing the kitchen clean .	Petunia
Uncle [MASK] might still have been able to make his deal – if it had n't been for the owl .	Vernon
Aunt [MASK] was just handing round a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs Mason 's head and swooped out again .	Petunia
Mrs [MASK] screamed like a banshee and ran from the house , shouting about lunatics .	Mason
Mr [MASK] stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes , and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke .	Mason
[MASK] stood in the kitchen , clutching the mop for support as Uncle Vernon advanced on him , a demonic glint in his tiny eyes .	Harry
[MASK] took it .	Harry
[MASK] did not contain birthday greetings .	It

[MASK] would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community ( Muggles ) is a serious offence , under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy .	We
[MASK] looked up from the letter and gulped .	Harry
[MASK] was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared .	He
Well , [MASK] 've got news for you , boy . I 'm locking you up you 're never going back to that school . Never . And if you try and magic yourself out – they 'll expel you !	I
And laughing like a maniac , [MASK] dragged Harry back upstairs .	he
Uncle [MASK] was as bad as his word .	Vernon
The following morning , [MASK] paid a man to fit bars on Harry 's window .	he
[MASK] himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door , so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day .	He
[MASK] let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening .	They
Three days later , the [MASK] were showing no sign of relenting and Harry could n't see any way out of his situation .	Dursleys
[MASK] lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him .	He
[MASK] was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it ?	What
Yet [MASK] at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low .	life
Now that the Dursleys knew they were n't going to wake up as fruitbats , [MASK] had lost his only weapon .	he
[MASK] might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts , but the way things were going , he 'd probably starve to death anyway .	Dobby
The [MASK] rattled and Aunt Petunia 's hand appeared , pushing a bowl of tinned soup into the room .	cat-flap
[MASK] , whose insides were aching with hunger , jumped off his bed and seized it .	Harry
The [MASK] was stone cold , but he drank half of it in one gulp .	soup
Then [MASK] crossed the room to Hedwig 's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray .	he
[MASK] ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust .	She
[MASK] put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed , somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup .	He
Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks , [MASK] would happen if he did n't turn up at Hogwarts ?	what
Would [MASK] be able to make the Dursleys let him go ?	they

Yawning and grumbling , the [MASK] slouched outside with Harry behind them .	Weasleys
The [MASK] was large , and in Harry 's eyes , exactly what a garden should be .	garden
The [MASK] would n't have liked it – there were plenty of weeds , and the grass needed cutting – but there were gnarled trees all around the walls , plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flowerbed and a big green pond full of frogs .	Dursleys
This is a gnome , [MASK] said grimly .	he
[MASK] was certainly nothing like Father Christmas .	It
[MASK] was small and leathery-looking , with a large , knobbly , bald head exactly like a potato .	It
[MASK] held it at arm 's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet ; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside-down .	Ron
Seeing the shocked look on Harry 's face , [MASK] added , It does n't hurt them – you 've just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n't find their way back to the gnomeholes .	Ron
[MASK] let go of the gnome 's ankles : it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge .	He
[MASK] learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes .	Harry
[MASK] decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge , but the gnome , sensing weakness , sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry 's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until –	He

Mr [MASK] took a long gulp of tea and sighed .	Weasley
of course , [MASK] 's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking – they 'll insist they just keep losing it .	it

I – [MASK] mean , he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley 's eyes , that – that was very wrong , boys – very wrong indeed	I
[MASK] slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase , which zigzagged its way up through the house .	They
On the third landing , a [MASK] stood ajar .	door
[MASK] just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap .	Harry
[MASK] climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it , saying Ronald 's Room .	They
[MASK] stepped in , his head almost touching the sloping ceiling , and blinked .	Harry
[MASK] was like walking into a furnace : nearly everything in Ron 's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange : the bedspread , the walls , even the ceiling .	It
Then [MASK] realised that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards , all wearing bright orange robes , carrying broomsticks , and waving energetically .	Harry
Ron 's magic [MASK] was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the window-sill , next to his fat grey rat , Scabbers , who was snoozing in a patch of sun .	wand
[MASK] stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window .	Harry
In the field far below [MASK] could see a gang of gnomes sneaking , one by one , back through the Weasleys hedge .	he

Personal [MASK] of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research . [ 1 - 3 ]	experiences
[MASK] have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [ 3 – 5 ] ;	Sociologists
[MASK] have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [ 6 ] ;	psychologists
[MASK] have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [ 7 – 9 ] ;	neuroscientists
and evolutionary [MASK] have explored the various ways that in - group / out - group biases emerged across the history of our species . [ 10 ]	theorists
In many respects , [MASK] already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ]	researchers
[MASK] also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices .	What
Even so , [MASK] of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare ( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) .	estimates
At least one prior [MASK] by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination ( see also , Gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) .	study
The current [MASK] seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States .	study
Additionally , the [MASK] address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences .	analysis
“ What do [MASK] think was the main reason for these experiences ? ”	you
Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences , the built - in skip [MASK] resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) .	pattern
Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews , [MASK] use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview .	we
The logic is that ( nearly ) all Wave 4 [MASK] appeared in the Wave 1 sample , but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition .	respondents
First , [MASK] is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 .	age
Our exploratory [MASK] included three basic steps .	study
Second , [MASK] examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category .	we
Finally , [MASK] assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories .	we
The p - [MASK] associated with the design - based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data .	value
This final [MASK] also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination .	step

In the south , the [MASK] known as Kamobeul Bolon separates Mof-Ávvi from the Bayot speaking area , while the west side of Mof-Ávvi coincides with the homeland of the Jóola Kaasa Húluf and Jóola Kaasa Ésuulaaluʔ .	river
The [MASK] in Figure 2 below , adapted from Palmeri and Gazio ( 1995 ) , shows a very approximate location of Mof-Ávvi in relation to other neighbouring speech communities .	map
For example , the [MASK] Kusiilay 1 ‘ the language of Essil ’ , is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language , because Essil , of which Bajjat was a district , is the village which has a border with their village .	name

[MASK] , ‘ the language of village of Seleki / Sállagi ’ , is the name given by Jóola Kaasa speakers who are more familiar with the village of Seleki / Sállagi ’ than all other villages of Mof-Ávvi .	Kúlaakiay
Finally , [MASK] / Bandial ‘ the language of the village of Banjal ’ , the most popular of all those names , is the name given by the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny speakers to Eegimaa people and their language , because people from the village of Banjal were the first to be in contact with them .	Banjal
Jóola language [MASK] which are closely related to Eegimaa include Kujireray / Kuluunaay ( from the village of Brin with 76 % lexical similarity ) and Gufiñamay ( from the village of Afiniam with 74 % lexical similarity ( based on Lewis et al. , 2014 eds. ) ) .	varieties

Nowadays most Eegimaa [MASK] from Mof-Ávvi live outside their homeland , generally in urban areas like Ziguinchor and Dakar .	speakers

After Bedřich Smetana , [MASK] was the next Czech Romantic - era composer to achieve worldwide recognition .	he
Following Smetana 's nationalist example , [MASK] frequently employed aspects , specifically rhythms , of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia .	Dvořák
[MASK] displayed his musical gifts at an early age , being an apt violin student from age six .	Dvořák
The first public [MASK] of his works were in Prague in 1872 and , with special success , in 1873 , when he was aged 31 .	performances
Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , [MASK] submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later .	he
In 1874 [MASK] made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition , including scores of two further symphonies and other works .	he
Although Dvořák was not aware of it , [MASK] Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed .	Johannes
[MASK] recommended Dvořák to his publisher , Simrock , who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances , Op. 46 .	Brahms
In his career , [MASK] made nine invited visits to England , often conducting performances of his own works .	Dvořák
Visiting Russia in March 1890 , [MASK] conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . [ 3 ]	he
In 1890 – 91 , [MASK] wrote his Dumky Trio , one of his most successful chamber music pieces .	he
In 1892 , [MASK] moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City .	Dvořák
While in the United States , [MASK] wrote his two most successful orchestral works : the Symphony From the New World , which spread his reputation worldwide , [ 4 ] and his Cello Concerto , one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti .	Dvořák
[MASK] also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music , the American String Quartet , during this time .	He

[MASK] Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen ( Danish : [ ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩ ] ; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943 ) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language .	Jens
[MASK] entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17 , initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies .	He
In 1881 [MASK] shifted his focus completely to languages , and in 1887 earned his master 's degree in French , with English and Latin as his secondary languages .	he
[MASK] supported himself during his studies through part - time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament .	He
In 1887 – 1888 , [MASK] traveled to England , Germany and France , meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University .	he
Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen , [MASK] returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system .	he
[MASK] successfully defended his dissertation in 1891 .	He
[MASK] was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925 , and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21 .	Jespersen
His early [MASK] focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics , but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development .	work
[MASK] advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers : Sprogets logik ( 1913 ) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser ( 1921 ) .	He
[MASK] in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " .

So [MASK] helps .	that
Do [MASK] need a partner ?	you
Besides , you , I mean if [MASK] 're a guy , if —	you
If you 're a woman , I mean , those [MASK] 'll be all over you .	guys
[MASK] swear it .	I
[MASK] could come too .	You
Well [MASK] do n't necessarily mean , in a bad way , even though I 'm sure there are a few there , I 'm not dancing with guys .	I
All I can say is , the [MASK] are n't all over me .	women
But , but [MASK] remember , like I went there with this person , it 's kind of funny .	I
Th- this [MASK] did not want to dance .	person
So [MASK] 's just gon na watch .	she
So , every once in a while [MASK] 'd get up and dance , and it 's like , when I 'd come back , I mean there was some guy there , sitting in my chair .	I
[MASK] 'm thinking , God these guys do n't waste any time .	I
I mean , [MASK] turn your back and there 's somebody moving in .	you
I mean [MASK] do n't know if they —	I
Maybe Harold [MASK] should come with me .	you
So [MASK] can find — find some girls with empty chairs next to em ?	I
Maybe [MASK] should go with Miles .	I
Yeah , you [MASK] could be partners .	guys
Well [MASK] do n't know if I told you , told you that story about that woman , who uh , went after that guy there ?	I
[MASK] told you that story , right ?	I
[MASK] was there Sunday three four weeks ago ?	I
Uh , after the class is over w- over with , [MASK] 'm sitting down at a table , there 's a woman from — who was in the class , and two men , sitting to my right , is a table with two women there .	I
[MASK] had apparently just come from Oba Oba .	They
Oh [MASK] think you told me .	I
And like , well [MASK] were attractive women , the one had on a real real short skirt .	they
And the [MASK] was just looking at him , making eyes , then she went out there , got on her knees , in front of him , in this skirt that 's this short , takes her hands , and goes along his toes , and then up , and is just doing like that .	woman
[MASK] figured , oh , they must know each other .	I
[MASK] 's what I assumed .	That
And , [MASK] did that for the whole dance , and I mean , she was d- all kind of suggestive stuff , and touching him and everything , people would like cheering , and clapping , " go for it " .	they
The – the [MASK] ended , the guy set down , at another table .	song
And [MASK] set down —	she
[MASK] never danced again the rest of the evening .	They
This is like — so [MASK] was thinking , this woman 's sitting about as far away from me as Jamie is .	I
And [MASK] was thinking , hm , this is interesting .	I
[MASK] wonder how long it was gon na take the guys in this club to move in on her .	I
No sooner did I think this thought , [MASK] were over there .	guys
Well [MASK] was still trying to figure out , surely they must know each other , I mean , why was n't he sitting at her table ?	I
[MASK] mean , you were still thinking about it .	You
Anyway , this guy , I mean [MASK] comes over there , immediately afterwards —	he
No , [MASK] 's just some random guy .	it
[MASK] was sitting there , there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are .	He
And then these two [MASK] are sitting here .	women
So uh , [MASK] comes over there , and is talking with that woman I do n't know about what , but then like ten minutes later , she and her friend are over at their table .	he
And then , twenty minutes later , [MASK] were kinda like all over each other .	they
And [MASK] was thinking , it looks like these people are n't going home alone tonight .	I
But [MASK] just thought that —	I
Well , maybe [MASK] should n't go there then .	I
Yeah , maybe [MASK] should n't .	you
[MASK] has been , has taken such an interest in this retirement bit that it — it really surprises me .	Sam
Well [MASK] 's begun to listen .	she
Yes [MASK] has .	she
[MASK] know .	You
[MASK] has .	She
Uh , [MASK] used to go over and read a book or something .	she
[MASK] was for sure .	That
But uh , once you understand it , you know , you , [MASK] 're interested in getting right in , and going after it .	you
[MASK] really ought a call , at least Reg Barr , and ask if uh , he 's still speaking to me .	I
Well now , [MASK] was the one that was up on the left , up there .	he
Well , [MASK] came over to you all smiles , I noticed .	he
Well , [MASK] 've known each other for thirty - some years , why would n't he ?	we
But a- anyway , um , [MASK] was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit .	I
Because [MASK] was Burns that 's been objecting to our having it .	it
And [MASK] knew this .	I
So when [MASK] opened up on that , and she followed through , and told about her husband , you know ?	he
Not necessarily that [MASK] would approve of it , but at least she was n't disapproving .	she
And uh , course [MASK] might –	Duvall
And I – [MASK] can not get over this .	I
[MASK] really can not .	I
And you know , he must have been thinking , when he said he was n't a political appointee , [MASK] must have been associating his relationship with Steitler .	he
[MASK] really do believe that .	I
[MASK] do n't know how else he could have done it .	I
[MASK] topples over .	That
Um , but [MASK] did n't say that .	he
[MASK] said , I loved your hum- humor , uh , and I love you , but , I am not a political appointee .	He
And his [MASK] were just snapping .	eyes
And [MASK] said , Oh ? How did you get on the board ?	I
Well [MASK] said , I got a letter from the governor , asking .	he
[MASK] on there is an app- political appointee , that was n't the point .	Everybody
The point was , [MASK] could have mentioned what was in the paper about him , that he was related and , you know , had business with Steitler , and I just said , and there 's Doctor Duvall , you know ?	I
And then [MASK] went to Rotus , who 's a seasoned politician , if there ever was one .	I
[MASK] just would flare .	He
And [MASK] said , well , I – alright .	I
[MASK] said , I 'll apologize next time , and I 'm gon na make hay out of it , do n't you worry .	I
[MASK] wan na know how you birds got on that board , if you 're not political appointees .	I
Can [MASK] grow some basil ?	I
Yes , [MASK] 's how I 've –	that
[MASK] do n't have any this year , but I 've grown it other years .	I
[MASK] will not take any frost .	It
A little bit of frost , [MASK] 's gone .	it
I l- [MASK] learned that one time the –	I
[MASK] learned it just went down .	I
Well , [MASK] think it was Barbara that has some seeds .	I

Well , yeah , [MASK] do n't like that , do you , but –	you
No , [MASK] chokes me to death .	it
It 's – [MASK] 's there , might as well smoke it .	it

[MASK] ’re leaning on the railing , waiting to ask Derya about a job , watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight , flying down to make Frankfurt run .	You
[MASK] never get tired of watching them .	You
[MASK] ’s on the Holbeinsteg bridge .	She
[MASK] ’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth - century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars .	Someone
[MASK] ’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad - brimmed hat , and it ’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge ’s rail .	She
[MASK] ’s a strawberry blonde , slim , her skin blank and virginal as new butter .	She
[MASK] ’s beyond the rail now , hanging out over the mountain - high drop .	She
Thin translucent [MASK] move across her — the shadows of the neosilk - and - nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five - kilometer - high towers that encircle it .	shadows

Hot , animal [MASK] surges in your chest .	fear
[MASK] looks up at you and , across the gap of forty meters , smiles a brilliant , heartbreaking smile .	She
Then [MASK] lets go and falls .	she
[MASK] scream .	You
[MASK] steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook - nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps .	He
[MASK] swallow on a dry throat .	You
[MASK] , of all people , hearing you scream !	Derya

[MASK] wanted to be a dentist .	Steven
[MASK] was pretty much the first thing he told us when , as first years , we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroom .	It
When , a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house [MASK] saw that this was not an idle remark .	we
Where our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers , [MASK] had diagrams setting out tooth implementations , anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves , muscle , blood vessels , bones , and , of course , teeth .	Steven
Where we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes , [MASK] had plaster casts of jawbones , gums and teeth grinning down at us .	Steven
“ They do n’t exactly encourage my interest , ” [MASK] shrugged .	he
“ [MASK] sort of tolerate it .	They
But [MASK] says they ’re a sort of collection , and too expensive for me to play with . ”	Dad
Of course , [MASK] tried to pick the locks , but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained — tantalisingly — out of reach .	we
[MASK] did n’t see Steven ’s interest as strange , well , not that much .	We
[MASK] all had our own interests — drawing , electronics , collecting beer caps — that each appeared obscure to anyone else .	We
DIY [MASK] was just something that had never crossed our horizon before .	Dentistry
And if Steven did n’t see it as weird , or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern - Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand - written labels , why should [MASK] bother us ?	it
[MASK] suppose that , in our own way , we were all collectively strange .	I
Besides , [MASK] had some really good stuff : sweets that stained your teeth bright red — well , technically , not your teeth , just the plaque , but the result was often the same .	Steven
[MASK] had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside , and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkup .	He
[MASK] was n’t dangerous .	It
At least , [MASK] suppose so .	I
[MASK] was vaguely uncomfortable , and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn until , at last , Andy said he was game .	It
And [MASK] were off .	we
Your [MASK] filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm paste .	nose
And [MASK] seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own saliva .	you
[MASK] generally got better when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe , and swallow , normally .	Things
[MASK] watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch mouthing the quarters , before poking the setting goo to check its consistency .	He
Then , when he gave you the nod , [MASK] tried to prise your jaws apart .	you
As the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid , [MASK] thought it would never come off , as the others giggled at your expressions and grimaces .	you
[MASK] jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck ’s bill , turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragements .	Steven
And , then , with an awful sucking slurp , [MASK] came free .	it
The [MASK] then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil - smelling plastic slug invade your mouth , while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitement .	initiated
Raucous [MASK] greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatment .	laughter
The next [MASK] of the proceedings was less thrilling .	part
[MASK] measured and mixed the plaster of Paris and prepared for the cast by using a bright blue putty to build up the form of the jaw , and shoring up gaps and holes .	Steven
[MASK] get even less exciting when he said we ’d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solid .	It
But the next time we visited his room [MASK] got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelf .	we
[MASK] were all perfectly happy with the result , even wanting one as a trophy until Steven passed an expert eye over them , pointing out here a gap , here a filling , and there a completely misaligned incisor .	We
[MASK] were , he told us , mediocre specimens for his collection .	We
[MASK] did n’t matter .	It
[MASK] were all friends , a group bonded by the common experience of being able to see our teeth on Steven ’s shelf .	We
[MASK] interviews Christopher Hill , U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate	Wikinews
What qualifications do [MASK] have that will assist you in executing the duties of president ?	you
[MASK] took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old .	I
[MASK] understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people .	I
[MASK] profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters .	Politicians
As President , [MASK] will serve ALL of the people in America , guided by the Constitution .	I
The Air [MASK] only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy , Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend .	Force
[MASK] volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the " Top of the Spear . "	I
In those days [MASK] was all or nothing .	it
[MASK] has proven itself ineffective as a body .	Congress
To make a difference in America [MASK] must have the " Bully Pulpit " and speak to the People .	you
The [MASK] has that pulpit .	President
[MASK] never wanted to make politics a career .	I
Why did [MASK] choose to run in the Republican Party ?	you
My [MASK] to the Republican party date back to 1979 , when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire .	ties
In those days [MASK] believed there was a difference in the parties .	I
Today , like many Americans , [MASK] am skeptical .	I
[MASK] understand third party candidates have no success .	I
[MASK] hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans .	I
How do [MASK] plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls ?	you
In order to be invited to the debates , [MASK] must raise money and poll nationally .	we
[MASK] is an effort that is underway .	This
If you do not receive the Republican nomination , would [MASK] consider running as a third party candidate ?	you
No , [MASK] will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016 .	I
After that , [MASK] may reconsider .	I
Other than yourself , which candidates have [MASK] supported for president in previous campaigns ?	you
Specifically , what would [MASK] have done differently ?	you
[MASK] Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his party .	President
His [MASK] of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional .	use
His [MASK] to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another example .	direction
If elected , [MASK] would constitute a successful presidency for you ?	what
What individuals would [MASK] like to see in a Hill administration ?	you
[MASK] would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation work .	I
[MASK] have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theory .	We
Anything else [MASK] would like to add ?	you
[MASK] is a nation that will endure .	America
[MASK] believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to us .	I
As President , [MASK] intend to keep that promise !	I
[MASK] interviews Robert Sarvis , Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Virginia	Wikinews
[MASK] Robert Sarvis , the Libertarian Party 's nominee for Governor of Virginia , answered five questions submitted via e-mail by accredited Wikinews reporter William Saturn .	Attorney
[MASK] has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election , an unusual feat for a third party candidate .	Sarvis
The latest Newsmax / Zogby [MASK] from late September placed him at 13 percent , 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli , Virginia 's Attorney General , and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe , the former Democratic National Committee chairman , with 24 percent undecided .	poll
On his campaign website , [MASK] notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers , simplification of Virginia 's Tax Code , US Second Amendment - gun - rights , same - sex marriage , and reform of the state 's drug laws .	Sarvis
With Wikinews , [MASK] discusses his background , views on McDonnell 's tenure , keys to campaign success , plan to implement his agenda , and the former Virginia governor he most admires .	Sarvis
[MASK] am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia , but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth .	I
( [MASK] am mixed - race ( half - Chinese ) and in an interracial marriage . )	I
[MASK] am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law , and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship .	I
Because of my academic and professional background , [MASK] understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates , and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum .	I
[MASK] am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law .	I
What would [MASK] have done differently than him ?	you
[MASK] did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession .	McDonnell
Those early budget [MASK] are his highest achievements as Governor .	efforts
More recently , [MASK] erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases , rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational , efficient , decentralized transportation decision - making .	he
[MASK] could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform , regulatory reform , and school choice .	He
Of course , [MASK] showed ethical lapses in judgment .	he
Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level , [MASK] have done exceptionally well in opinion polling .	you
What do [MASK] attribute that success to ?	you
[MASK] see the two - party system for the sham it has become .	Voters
[MASK] are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns .	They
[MASK] see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties , and they want something better .	Voters
[MASK] who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere , know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions , and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest .	Voters
[MASK] like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open - minded and Open for Business .	People
If elected governor , how will [MASK] be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature ?	you
[MASK] share many policy positions with each of the major parties .	Libertarians
Working together with both Republicans and Democrats , [MASK] can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both .	we
Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do [MASK] most admire and why ?	you
[MASK] would be a Libertarian today .	He

The earliest recorded [MASK] of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers , the scientists of their day .	discussion
In the fifth century BC , [MASK] and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small , finite particles that they called atomos , a term derived from the Greek word for “ indivisible . ”	Leucippus
[MASK] thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size , and which could join together .	They
Later , [MASK] and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “ elements ” — fire , earth , air , and water — and could be infinitely divided .	Aristotle
Interestingly , these [MASK] thought about atoms and “ elements ” as philosophical concepts , but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas .	philosophers
The Aristotelian [MASK] of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years , until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory .	view
First published in 1807 , [MASK] of Dalton ’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory .	many
An [MASK] is the smallest unit of an element that can participate in a chemical change .	atom
2. An [MASK] consists of only one type of atom , which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the same for all atoms of that element ( Figure 2.2 ) .	element
A macroscopic [MASK] of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms , all of which have identical chemical properties .	sample
A pre-1982 copper [MASK] ( left ) contains approximately 3 ×× 10 22 copper atoms ( several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right ) , each of which has the same chemical properties .	penny
3. [MASK] of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements .	Atoms
4. A [MASK] consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small , whole - number ratio .	compound
In a given compound , the [MASK] of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio ( Figure 2.3 ) .	numbers
Copper(II) [MASK] , a powdery , black compound , results from the combination of two types of atoms — copper ( brown spheres ) and oxygen ( red spheres ) — in a 1 : 1 ratio .	oxide
When the elements copper ( a shiny , red - brown solid , shown here as brown spheres ) and oxygen ( a clear and colorless gas , shown here as red spheres ) react , their [MASK] rearrange to form a compound containing copper and oxygen ( a powdery , black solid ) .	atoms
Dalton ’s atomic [MASK] provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you ’ve learned about .	theory
And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change , then the total [MASK] of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant ( the law of conservation of matter ) .	mass
In the following drawing , the green [MASK] represent atoms of a certain element .	spheres

15.4 The [MASK] Triumphant	Union
By the end of this section , [MASK] will be able to :	you
By the outset of 1864 , after three years of war , the [MASK] had mobilized its resources for the ongoing struggle on a massive scale .	Union
The [MASK] had overseen the construction of new railroad lines and for the first time used standardized rail tracks that allowed the North to move men and materials with greater ease .	government
The North ’s [MASK] had shifted to a wartime model .	economy
The [MASK] also mobilized , perhaps to a greater degree than the Union , its efforts to secure independence and maintain slavery .	Confederacy
Yet the [MASK] experienced ever - greater hardships after years of war .	Confederacy
Without the population of the North , [MASK] faced a shortage of manpower .	it
The [MASK] of industry , compared to the North , undercut the ability to sustain and wage war .	lack
Rampant [MASK] as well as food shortages in the South lowered morale .	inflation
From the beginning of the war , the [MASK] placed great hope in being recognized and supported by Great Britain and France .	Confederacy
European [MASK] in the conflict remained a strong possibility , but when it did occur , it was not in a way anticipated by either the Confederacy or the Union .	intervention
[MASK] III of France believed the Civil War presented an opportunity for him to restore a French empire in the Americas .	Napoleon
With the United States preoccupied , the [MASK] seemed ripe for action .	time
Napoleon ’s [MASK] was Mexico , and in 1861 , a large French fleet took Veracruz .	target
The [MASK] then moved to capture Mexico City , but the advance came to an end when Mexican forces defeated the French in 1862 .	French
Despite this setback , [MASK] eventually did conquer Mexico , establishing a regime that lasted until 1867 .	France
Rather than coming to the aid of the Confederacy , [MASK] used the Civil War to provide a pretext for efforts to reestablish its former eighteenth - century colonial holdings .	France
Still , the [MASK] had great confidence that it would find an ally in Great Britain despite the antislavery sentiment there .	Confederacy
[MASK] hoped Britain ’s dependence on cotton for its textile mills would keep the country on their side .	Southerners
The [MASK] that the British proved willing to build and sell ironclad ships intended to smash through the Union naval blockade further raised Southern hopes .	fact
The [MASK] purchased two of these armored blockade runners , the CSS Florida and the CSS Alabama .	Confederacy
The Confederacy ’s staunch [MASK] to slavery eventually worked against British recognition and support , since Great Britain had abolished slavery in 1833 .	commitment
The 1863 Emancipation [MASK] ended any doubts the British had about the goals of the Union cause .	Proclamation
In the aftermath of the proclamation , [MASK] in Great Britain cheered for a Union victory .	many
Ultimately , Great [MASK] , like France , disappointed the Confederacy ’s hope of an alliance , leaving the outnumbered and out - resourced states that had left the Union to fend for themselves .	Britain
At the beginning of the war , in 1861 and 1862 , Union [MASK] had used contrabands , or escaped enslaved people , for manual labor .	forces
The Emancipation [MASK] , however , led to the enrollment of African American men as Union soldiers .	Proclamation
Huge [MASK] of formerly enslaved as well as free Black people from the North enlisted , and by the end of the war in 1865 , their numbers had swelled to over 190,000 .	numbers
[MASK] among White people in the Union army ran deep , however , fueling the belief that Black soldiers could never be effective or trustworthy .	Racism
The [MASK] also feared for the fate of captured Black soldiers .	Union
Although many Black soldiers saw combat duty , these [MASK] affected the types of tasks assigned to them .	factors
This 1865 [MASK] illustrates three of the Union ’s distinct advantages : African American soldiers , a stream of cannons and supplies , and an extensive railroad grid . ( credit : Library of Congress )	daguerreotype
African American [MASK] also received lower wages than their White counterparts : ten dollars per month , with three dollars deducted for clothing .	soldiers
White [MASK] , in contrast , received thirteen dollars monthly , with no deductions .	soldiers
[MASK] and their Republican supporters in Congress worked to correct this discriminatory practice , and in 1864 , Black soldiers began to receive the same pay as White soldiers plus retroactive pay to 1863 ( Figure 15.17 ) .	Abolitionists
African American and White [MASK] of the Union army pose together in this photograph , although in reality , Black soldiers were often kept separate and given only menial jobs .	soldiers
For their part , African American [MASK] welcomed the opportunity to prove themselves .	soldiers
Some 85 [MASK] were formerly enslaved people who were fighting for the liberation of all of the enslaved and the end of slavery .	percent
When given the opportunity to serve , many Black [MASK] did so heroically .	regiments
One such [MASK] , the Fifty - Fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers , distinguished itself at Fort Wagner in South Carolina by fighting valiantly against an entrenched Confederate position .	regiment
[MASK] willingly gave their lives for the cause .	They
The [MASK] , not surprisingly , showed no mercy to African American troops .	Confederacy
In April 1864 , Southern [MASK] attempted to take Fort Pillow in Tennessee from the Union forces that had captured it in 1862 .	forces
Confederate [MASK] under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest , the future founder of the Ku Klux Klan , quickly overran the fort , and the Union defenders surrendered .	troops
Instead of taking the African American soldiers prisoner , as they did the White soldiers , the [MASK] executed them .	Confederates
The [MASK] outraged the North , and the Union refused to engage in any future exchanges of prisoners with the Confederacy .	massacre
[MASK] is up guys ?	What
So in today 's video , [MASK] 'm finally gon na be doing a room tour .	I
[MASK] know this is something that you guys have requested for a very long time , and after two and a half years of living here , I finally feel like I 've made it my own and decorated it how I want , and I 'm ready to show it to you guys .	I
Honestly , if I was redoing this from the beginning , [MASK] would have really liked to have a double bed in this room , but , unfortunately , with the space as you can probably see from that wall there till the door , it 's basically just enough to fit a bed and a couch , and this is my couch over here .	I
[MASK] 've recently changed it , and if you 've been following my channel for a long time , then you 'll know I 'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe , the gray and yellow cushions .	I
This [MASK] is also quite big , it fits three people quite comfortably , and if I have family or friends staying over , it opens up into a full double bed .	couch
This coffee table over here , [MASK] 's glass and has two levels , so it 's really good when we have multiple friends over , and we have lots of food to put on the table , or if we 're playing board games , we can have people sit around it , and still have a lot of space to lay everything out .	it
[MASK] 've got an ironing board , all of my suitcases , socks , clothes that I do n't wear that often , anything that I need for fixing the house like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things that I definitely would n't want to have laid out in my room , but I still need somewhere in the house .	I
[MASK] love that this room has floor - to - ceiling windows as well , it really lets the light come in , especially in the summer time .	I
[MASK] know London does n't have that much light , but I 'll take as much as I can , and there 's also a small balcony out here , which is fairly rare for London .	I
[MASK] have two chairs where we can sit down and sort of enjoy the weather when it is a little bit better , um but now it 's really cold so just gon na close it .	We
And then a little behind the scenes that you probably will never see again in a video is that down here [MASK] keep all of the filming gear that does n't really fit anywhere else in the room : two sets of tripods , I also have a c - stand .	I
Okay next to my bed , [MASK] 've got the radio alarm clock , and this has actually changed my life .	I
[MASK] makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m. when it 's pitch black outside so much easier when you 're waking up really early .	It
Over here on the wall , [MASK] are posters that I actually bought back in 2013 in my first year of university in Toronto , and I really really liked them so I 've kept them around .	these
Also [MASK] 'm really proud that I managed to put them up all by myself , they look quite neat , and I feel like they 're equally spaced , so I 'm really proud of how they turned out .	I
Hey [MASK] 's up guys ?	what
Today [MASK] 'm doing another college day in my life .	I
And [MASK] just left Starbucks , do n't mind what I look like .	I
[MASK] literally just pretty much woke up and left this morning .	I
[MASK] 'm starting the review for all the chapters for my final exam , and it is a lot of information so I already planned on getting up early today and going .	I
And then [MASK] 'm gon na do the same thing tomorrow .	I
[MASK] basically like created a digital calendar where I 'm gon na go over each of the chapters , just because I only have one week left to study .	I
[MASK] 'm back home now , and I basically just typed up a little calendar laying out the chapters that I have left to review before Tuesday .	I
[MASK] 's my final list and I hate that , like , this week is our Thanksgiving break and then we literally come back Tuesday and take our final .	That
So [MASK] 'm gon na be studying on Thanksgiving Day , Black Friday , and the whole weekend even though we 're going getting our Christmas tree I think on Saturday , and I I 'm not decorating I 'm not doing anything fun , like I have to study .	I
[MASK] thought I would show you guys kind of how I 'm mapping this out , because it 's a really good tip if you have like a lot to do .	I
So today [MASK] 'm doing female reproductive system , male reproductive system tomorrow .	I
[MASK] work on Wednesday , I 'm going to go over chapter 29 fluid balance , chapter 28 so urinary system on the 29th .	I
And then on Sunday , [MASK] 'll be doing chapters 23 through 27 and I just made this on my iPad and then printed it .	I
[MASK] did not include my schedule for college algebra because I have a final on Thursday of next week for that .	I
So [MASK] 'm going to go in with like a different color and add in the chapters I 'm gon na be studying for that , but I 'm super stressed .	I
[MASK] bought these Vans from DSW .	I
[MASK] are really cute .	They
You [MASK] know I have the white ones and I wear them all the time and these ones are just like black perforated Vans .	guys
[MASK] love them and they are definitely the right size because I have two other pairs of Vans that are this size , but one of these ones is like messed up or something .	I
[MASK] think it 's like this part on the left foot because my foot feels super tight in only the left side , so something 's up because they 're both the right size but I do n't know .	I
So [MASK] 'm gon na exchange them for another pair because something 's not right about that .	I
So [MASK] just got finished at the library .	I
[MASK] just sat in there for like an hour and a half straight and studied .	I
[MASK] 'm really proud of myself and now I 'm about to go get some lunch , and go to DSW and see if I can exchange those Vans .	I
So while I was in the library [MASK] of you guys came up to me , and said hi .	one
[MASK] feel so bad because I was so in the zone that I did n't even get her name .	I
[MASK] said she watches my videos and loves them .	She
And you [MASK] are so sweet , I love making videos and it 's so nice to have that support .	guys
[MASK] just got out of DSW , and I spent like 30 minutes in there because it was just such a process for them to do an exchange .	I
And then [MASK] had to scan and go get the shoes and then she said they did n't have the size .	she
So [MASK] ended up having to order them , but she said there was no way to do a direct exchange .	I
So [MASK] had to give me a return and then re-ring it up .	she
And oh my gosh [MASK] was literally in there for like 25 minutes all to just do a simple exchange for the exact same shoe .	I
But [MASK] 's over now and they 're gon na send them to me in the mail .	it
Hopefully [MASK] 'll be here in about a week .	they
[MASK] 'm just kind of sad that they did n't have them in stock , so now I have to wait .	I
But oh well [MASK] 's over with now , we 're gon na go get lunch .	it

[MASK] is the largest island , where Neiafu is found .	This
[MASK] is a limestone island with heights up to 213 m in the west .	It
The [MASK] provides a home to eleven indigenous bird species and contains Mt. Talau national park , with some of the limited remaining native vegetation .	island
Tropical [MASK] includes the pandanus or screw pine , the casuarina , and the mulberry tree , the bark of which is used to make tapa cloth .	vegetation
[MASK] is the second largest island in the Group .	This
Avai'o'vuna [MASK] is a small coastal wetland on the island .	Swamp
[MASK] is some 35 minutes from Neiafu Harbour and provides the main concentration of humpback whales .	This

The Beavertail [MASK] ( Opunitia basilares ) , found primarily in the Mojave Desert and northwest Mexico ; can grow to be about 24 inches ( 60 cm ) high ; has pads that look like beavertails ; and yields red or purple flowers from spring to early summer .	Cactus
Beavertail cacti [MASK] need shade to grow , whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight .	seeds
[MASK] can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers .	It
[MASK] can purchase them online or at a local garden center .	You
If you already own a Beavertail cactus , [MASK] can make your own cuttings .	you
If you plant the cuttings too deep , [MASK] might rot .	they
[MASK] will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day .	This
The [MASK] in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow .	moisture
Too much [MASK] might cause rot .	water
After 1 month , [MASK] will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time .	roots
Once fully rooted , [MASK] are extremely drought resistant .	they
During the spring , summer , and fall , the Beavertail [MASK] grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer .	cactus
From the first pad , many [MASK] will form .	more
The second or third [MASK] will bear some flowers , but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests .	pad

Peppermint [MASK] is a natural deterrent .	oil
The [MASK] is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it .	smell
[MASK] also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning .	It
[MASK] also gives the house a lovely smell , and is not toxic , unlike many synthetic chemical treatments .	It
[MASK] can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores . [ 2 ]	You
Peppermint oil cotton [MASK] need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days , depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it .	balls
[MASK] can use the mint in cooking , as well as it serving a deterrent purpose .	You
[MASK] can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake .	You
[MASK] will keep mice away . [ 3 ]	This
[MASK] should be available at your local home improvement store or online .	They
[MASK] work only on a single line of sight , so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking .	These
The [MASK] may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them . [ 4 ]	units
Many [MASK] that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons .	companies
[MASK] of these products use natural ingredients , such as peppermint , that are known to be disagreeable to mice .	Many
[MASK] will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied .	They
These [MASK] should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center .	products
A house [MASK] can take care of the problem .	cat
[MASK] that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse .	Cats
[MASK] typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser .	Kittens
Well - food indoor [MASK] might just see the mouse as a toy , and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless .	kitties
[MASK] and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter , and generally do not test for this .	Shelters
Sometimes this [MASK] is available , but usually not .	information
While many mousers are great pets as well , not [MASK] are .	all
Even if you do not have a cat , [MASK] can use used kitty litter to deter mice .	you
The [MASK] will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy .	mice
If you have a large infestation , a [MASK] may not be enough to totally get rid of it .	cat
However , once you eliminate the infestation , a [MASK] will probably prevent reinfestation . [ 5 ]	cat
[MASK] smell garbage and get attracted to your house .	Mice
If you keep the cans away from the house , [MASK] are less likely to take up residence in your home .	they
[MASK] may take some time , but it 's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard . [ 6 ]	This
A barn [MASK] is the best .	owl
A [MASK] of barn owls can eat many mice in a night !	family
However , [MASK] might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box .	you

How do [MASK] look at and experience art ?	people
Which elements of specific artworks do [MASK] focus on ?	they
Do museum [MASK] have an impact on how people look at artworks ?	labels
The viewing [MASK] of art is a complex one , involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision - making , affect , and emotion .	experience
Thus , the [MASK] it takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal .	time
This [MASK] describes a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .	paper
The Jacob [MASK] at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose - built surroundings .	cycle
In this paper , [MASK] report upon the novel insights eye - tracking techniques have provided into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks .	we
[MASK] will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .	We
The [MASK] brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies to explore , using eye - tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .	project
Our [MASK] of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .	experience
When regarding an artwork , a [MASK] gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .	viewer
Previous eye tracking [MASK] has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .	research
Zurbarán ’s [MASK] of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years .	cycle
[MASK] is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose - built surroundings in the UK , and one of very few of its kind in the world .	It
[MASK] has a long history in scholarship ( Baron & Beresford 2014 ) , but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .	It
In this study [MASK] used eye - tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .	we
This pilot [MASK] primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye - tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour .	project
Tenured and tenure - track university [MASK] play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers .	faculty
Past [MASK] establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity .	studies
As an example , [MASK] shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers .	research
Further , [MASK] of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines .	rates
For instance , gender [MASK] in computing is an important issue with broad implications [ 5 ] , but without a full census of computing faculty , the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [ 6 ] .	representation
Most [MASK] , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all - encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web - based faculty directories for individual departments .	fields
Because assembling such a full census is difficult , past [MASK] have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] .	studies
Although useful , such [MASK] are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability .	samples
[MASK] of the largest census efforts to date assembled , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] .	One
This data [MASK] has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] .	set
But , this data [MASK] is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .	set
In some fields , yearly [MASK] on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate .	data
In computer science , the Computing Research [MASK] ( CRA ) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .	Association
Such [MASK] can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .	surveys
First , [MASK] are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames , which can inject bias into fine - grained analyses [ 21 , 22 ] .	surveys
Second , aggregate [MASK] provides only a high - level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .	information
Here , [MASK] present a novel system , based on a topical web crawler , that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web .	we
This [MASK] is efficient and accurate , and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection .	system
The [MASK] is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off - the - shelf computing hardware , a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [ 19 ] .	system
By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone , this [MASK] will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings , without having to rely on surveys or professional societies .	system
Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the [MASK] can elucidate scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances .	system
In short , many important research [MASK] will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently - recollected census data .	questions
[MASK] begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework .	We
Next , [MASK] present the results of our work in two sections .	we
The [MASK] demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing it to a hand - curated census , collected in 2011 [ 19 ] .	first
The [MASK] provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the “ leaky pipeline ” problem in faculty retention .	second
Throughout the second half of the 20th century , [MASK] have witnessed the return of institutions to economic analysis .	we
The [MASK] of the Nobel Prize in Economics to its main representatives ( Douglass North , Ronald Coase , Oliver Williamson , and Elinor Ostrom ) has contributed to its greater recognition .	awarding
The two main [MASK] of this economic approach are the concepts of transaction costs and institutions , analyzed by Coase and North , respectively .	notions
[MASK] [ 13 , 14 ] argues that economic transactions involve costs , and where these costs outweigh the gains , the exchange will not take place .	Coase
For its part , [MASK] defined the institutions as the “ rules of the game ” : they determine the structure of the economy , establish incentives for economic behavior , and affect social interaction [ 12 ] .	North
Thus , [MASK] also determine the level of uncertainty to which individuals are subject , stimulating or discouraging transactions .	institutions
A viable [MASK] requires an institutional structure that reduces existing uncertainty and guarantees property rights .	economy
Of course , the [MASK] takes a lead role in promoting this type of institution .	state
The [MASK] must protect property rights , provide public services , and ensure a sound judiciary .	state
[MASK] is responsible also for imposing order and promoting a climate of cooperation among agents , penalizing all violators of contracts [ 17 ] .	It
The [MASK] to a prosperous society is not an easy one .	path
If there are disagreements about the policies to be implemented , then the [MASK] that wins the political game will make the final decision .	group
On the one hand , a [MASK] that adopts policies promoting inclusive political institutions will develop pluralist and centralized institutions .	society
Inclusive [MASK] guarantee the right to private property , to an impartial legal system and promote a society based on equal conditions .	institutions
These [MASK] benefit not only the elites , but society as a whole .	institutions
In governments with extractive policies , the [MASK] in power usually extracts resources from the rest of the population for its own enrichment and well - being .	group
Another feature of this type of government is that powerful interest [MASK] oppose increased pluralism because it typically results in the loss of their privileges .	groups
[MASK] in power have little interest in their power devolving to a greater number of agents , as would occur under political institutions that were more pluralistic [ 16 ] .	Those
The institutional [MASK] of a state and its constitution are responsible for restricting predatory action — even by the state itself — and for creating rules that benefit the community [ 18 ] .	structure
Moreover , compliance [MASK] must reflect ex ante and ex post standards [ 12 ] .	mechanisms
But [MASK] happens when property rights are not respected ?	what
All these [MASK] have a place in this case analysis .	questions
The [MASK] of YPF is a case in which the Argentine State presents predatory behavior , encouraged by an extractive institutional framework .	expropriation
In a scenario with insecure property rights , asymmetric information , and a judicial system that acts as a lax enforcement mechanism , as discussed in the following sections , the [MASK] is difficult to attract .	FDI
In order to understand policymaking and its effects , [MASK] must have adequate knowledge of the focal country ’s institutional framework .	one
[MASK] of Argentina ’s governments have been of the predatory type .	Most
The country ’s unequal economic [MASK] originated in the colonial era and reflects how the Spanish metropolis influenced the establishment of extractive institutions [ 7 ] .	growth
Argentine [MASK] are therefore highly unstable .	politics
[MASK] takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of poetry ( Domínguez Caparrós , 2000 : 103 ) , giving rise to different stylistic effects ( e.g. increased emphasis on elements of the broken - up phrase , or contrast between those elements ) , or creating double interpretations for the enjambed lines ( García - Paje , 1991 ) .	Enjambment
However , a larger - scale [MASK] to identify enjambment across hundreds of authors spanning several centuries , enabling distant reading ( Moretti , 2013 ) , was not previously available .	study
Given that need , [MASK] have developed software , based on Natural Language Processing , that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish , and applied it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors , from the 15th to the 19th century .	we
[MASK] is the interest of such large - scale automatic analyses of enjambment ?	What
First , the [MASK] shows a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment , if split across two lines , and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify enjambment .	literature
Second , the stylistic [MASK] that enjambment permits are also an object of current research ( Martínez Fernández , 2010 ) .	effects
Finally , our [MASK] complements Navarro ’s ( 2016 ) automatic metrical analyses of Spanish Golden Age sonnets , by covering a wider period and focusing on enjambment .	study
First [MASK] provide the definition of enjambment adopted .	we
The project ’s [MASK] provides details omitted here for space reasons , including samples for the corpus , results , and other details .	website
Syntactic and metrical [MASK] often match in poetry .	units
[MASK] ( 1964 ) performed poetry reading experiments , proposing that the following strongly connected elements give rise to enjambment , should a poetic - form pause break them up :	Quilis
[MASK] translated " lexical enjambment " from Quilis ’s terms " encabalgamiento léxico " or " tmesis " .	We
[MASK] translated " phrase - bounded enjambment " from " encabalgamiento sirremático " .	We
[MASK] translated " cross-clause enjambment " from Quilis ’s " encabalgamiento oracional " .	We
The project [MASK] includes Quilis ’s complete list of syntactic environments that can trigger enjambment , as well as the types identified by our system .	site
Besides the enjambment types above , [MASK] ( 1983 ) noted that if a subject or direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry , this can also feel unusual for a reader , even if the effect is less pronounced than in the environments identified by Quilis .	Spang
To differentiate these cases from enjambment proper , [MASK] calls these cases " enlace " , translated here as " expansion " .	Spang
[MASK] ( 1964 ) was the only author so far to gather recitation - based experimental evidence on enjambment .	Quilis
Our [MASK] identifies Quilis ’ types , besides Spang ’s expansion cases .	system
[MASK] can rationally choose between experts only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known :	Agents
if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility , [MASK] must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources ( on pain of infinite regress ) .	they
In fact , many , if not all , the [MASK] of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition .	markers
The [MASK] that these criteria are widely known , however , offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting .	fact
[MASK] live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise .	We
This [MASK] , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources .	fact
For instance , [MASK] with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise , taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in .	those
For example , a small [MASK] of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds ) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care .	number
Such an [MASK] is surely permissible , but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large .	organization
Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many [MASK] mistook the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] .	people
When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , [MASK] introduces an epistemic pollutant .	it
A yet more egregious [MASK] of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer - reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] .	example
The [MASK] hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability .	companies
When the deceit was uncovered , however , the [MASK] was just the opposite :	effect
More recently , [MASK] of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so - called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee .	institutions
Once again , this [MASK] has the effect of making peer - reviewed journals appear less legitimate .	phenomenon
At times , even [MASK] who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal ’s legitimacy , and there are genuine borderline cases .	those
For example , the Frontiers [MASK] of journals appears legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8	contingent
Yet some Frontiers [MASK] appear to have engaged in bad behavior , whether for profit or for some other motive .	journals
[MASK] in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] .	Frontiers
Whether due to this behavior or not , [MASK] Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] .	Jeffrey
The [MASK] surrounding Beall ’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals .	controversy
If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate , [MASK] can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments .	one
If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution , [MASK] can hardly blame them .	one
Epistemic [MASK] may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9	pollution
For example , [MASK] may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise .	pollution
These [MASK] do not exist solely to credential experts .	institutions
[MASK] have other functions , and these functions may come into conflict , creating pressures to inflate credentials .	They
For example , [MASK] have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students .	universities
For this reason , [MASK] may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud , and they may try to keep their discoveries in - house to protect their reputations .	institutions
Cognitive [MASK] involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition , while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts , fun and cognition , for the improvement of cognitive functions .	games
The [MASK] is the main point made in this study , since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools .	attention
With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes , [MASK] suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills ( Li , Polat , Scalzo , & Bavelier , 2010 ) ; on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously ( Dye & Bavelier , 2010 ; Feng , Spence , & Pratt , 2007 ) ; and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time ( Boot , Kramer , Simons , Fabiani , & Gratton , 2008 ) .	researchers
Other [MASK] specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , & Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller & Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , & Klingberg , 2009 ) .	studies
The [MASK] in question focuses on the attention , proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom .	study
Thus , [MASK] suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom .	it
The [MASK] have features like increasing challenges , rules that establish what can and can not be done , and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game ( Kirriemuir & McFarlane , 2004 ; Prensky , 2005 ) .	games
[MASK] aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database , of the Escola do Cérebro , for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills , highlighting the attention .	We
The [MASK] involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions , especially the working memory , attention and capacity of solving problems .	games
The [MASK] combines qualitative and quantitative approaches .	study
[MASK] collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students to identify their perceptions of digital games ’ contributions to the learning process .	It
Furthermore , before and after the implementation of the intervention , [MASK] performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention , as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed .	we
The [MASK] consisted in the use of the Escola do Cérebro , using tablets in the classroom , daily for a period of five weeks .	intervention
The [MASK] consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control .	sample
The [MASK] ( n = 31 ) participated in the intervention , the control group ( n = 40 ) was only evaluated using the test before and after the same time interval of interventions .	first
The [MASK] do Cérebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database .	Escola
The [MASK] allows visualization of the player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers .	application
[MASK] have their scores measured by four variables : time , speed , stability and accuracy .	Students
The [MASK] in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 ( 64.75 ) respectively , while the control group was 20.00 ( 42.65 ) .	difference
The [MASK] indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test , as well as a high dispersion , which reveals a variation in relation to the performance .	result
In addition , [MASK] participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving , recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities , and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention .	students
The [MASK] observed changes after the intervention , emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities , and in some students , improvement in the ability to sustain attention .	teachers
From this , [MASK] conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention .	we
A fundamental tenet of linguistic science is that the [MASK] of a word has a purely arbitrary connection to the word 's meaning [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .	sound
But it is not that a [MASK] can have just any vocal sound .	word
While the possibility space for sound systems of the world 's language is enormous , any given [MASK] makes use of only a restricted portion of the possible sounds [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .	language
But in this study [MASK] present a striking exception to this otherwise robust rule .	we
From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents [MASK] find evidence suggesting that a word like ‘ Huh ? ’ – used as a ‘ repair initiator ’ when , for example , one has not clearly heard what someone just said [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] – is a universal word .	we
In support of the first claim , [MASK] show that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit .	we
In fact the [MASK] in form in unrelated languages across the globe is about the same as the variation we find in the way any regular word ( e.g. , dog ) is pronounced across dialects of English .	variation
In support of the second claim , [MASK] show that Huh ? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt .	we
Thus , in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and for huh ? in particular [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [MASK] find that this item is linguistic in nature rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound .	we
[MASK] show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems .	We
[MASK] ? may be a non-prototypical word , but it is a word .	Huh
Finally , [MASK] address the question of why all languages should have such a word and why its form should be so similar across languages .	we
[MASK] observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages .	We
After speaker G makes a statement , [MASK] E utters the interjection huh ? .	speaker
The technical [MASK] for this type of sequence is “ open other - initiated repair ” :	term
The actual repair [MASK] in response to this interjection is usually simply repetition , sometimes with slight modification .	operation
[MASK] 2 and 3 show structurally identical sequences in two other languages : Siwu , a Kwa language spoken in Ghana , and Lao , a Tai - Kadai language spoken in Laos .	Extracts
These [MASK] show that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages .	examples
Essentially , this [MASK] gives us a natural control over conversational data , making possible systematic comparison across languages [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .	method
[MASK] leads to the question driving our study :	This
is [MASK] ? in this context a universal word ?	huh
By compiling data from published literature [MASK] found that in thirty - one languages around the world , the interjection for other - initiated repair appears to be strongly similar ( Figure 1 ) .	we
However , written [MASK] are rarely explicit about the precise form , meaning , and use of interjections .	sources
Therefore [MASK] collected data from recordings of naturally occurring informal conversations in a sample of 10 languages from 5 continents , varying fundamentally in terms of phonology , word structure , and grammar ( languages 1 – 10 in Figure 1 ) .	we
For optimal comparability , [MASK] studied the exact same conversational environment across languages : that of other - initiated repair ( OIR ) , in which one participant produces a turn at talk , the other then signals some trouble with this turn , and finally the first produces a next turn which aims to solve the trouble , usually by means of repetition and / or modification .	we
Such alternative ( and probably derived ) [MASK] provide insight in possible paths of semantic change , but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like .	uses
[MASK] hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult - like SI interpretations .	We
[MASK] expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult - like interpretations .	We
Further , [MASK] posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported , and in fact there was some non - adult - like performance , that there would be significant variability among the conditions , with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest .	we
[MASK] serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .	It
Future [MASK] need to include more participants and more items to increase power .	studies
Future [MASK] should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult - like performance emerges .	studies
Related cross-cultural [MASK] have resulted in insufficient statistical power , but interesting trends ( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .	studies
Previous [MASK] in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .	studies
The current [MASK] is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;	study
More specifically , [MASK] answered “ yes ” that the puppet described the pictures well .	they
[MASK] is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well .	This
Additional [MASK] with the methodology could improve outcomes .	training
Further [MASK] with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .	exploration
The cardinal [MASK] included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability , but larger numbers should be included in future research .	numbers
Albeit limited , these [MASK] provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga - speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .	results
This interesting [MASK] of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language - specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .	combination
Today ’s [MASK] will not survive a day without the help of lighting .	generation
In fact , someone ’s [MASK] , particularly at night , depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity .	productivity
[MASK] takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines .	Lighting
Nowadays , most commonly and widely used [MASK] in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) .	bulb
However , the main [MASK] of CFL is the mercury they contain .	problem
In response to the said problem , this project [MASK] gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light - emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals .	study
Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey ( HECS ) , [MASK] remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines .	electricity
About 87 [MASK] of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011 .	percent
As of 2016 , the [MASK] for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors .	demand
Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical [MASK] as shown in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption .	homes
[MASK] plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy ; it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [ 2 ] .	Lighting
[MASK] of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb .	One
The [MASK] of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage .	use
But [MASK] of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] .	each
Unfortunately , most of the time , [MASK] in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary .	people
Today , [MASK] are the most used lighting sources in the household .	CFLs
However , the main [MASK] of CFLs is the mercury they contain .	problem
[MASK] is persistent in the environment ; it never breaks down nor goes away .	It
This UV [MASK] interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light .	radiation
The acute and chronic [MASK] are the normal responses of the skin to UVR ; acute reactions considered will be erythema ( sunburn ) and vitamin D production .	effects
In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources , the [MASK] conducted this study .	proponents
Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials , the [MASK] conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb .	proponents
In this article , [MASK] propose the definition of specific mutation operators for testing Geographic Information Systems .	we
[MASK] describe the process for applying the operators and generating mutants , and present a case study where these mutation operators are applied to two real - world applications .	We
[MASK] : mutation operators ; geographic information systems ; mutation testing	Keywords
Mutation - based [MASK] [ 1 ] is a test technique that involves artificially introducing errors into a System Under Test ( SUT ) .	testing
A [MASK] is a copy of the system in which a change has been done that , in most cases , will lead to a behaviour different than expected .	mutant
In the state of the art , [MASK] have found mutation operators , both general purpose and specific to different technologies , languages and paradigms [ 2 – 9 ] .	we
However , these [MASK] are not adequate when trying to test software features associated with specific domains .	operators
In this article , [MASK] propose mutation operators specific to the domain of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) applications .	we
These [MASK] reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of applications .	operators
In addition , [MASK] present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real - world GIS applications and we generate the mutants .	we
As a previous step to designing the mutation operators , [MASK] analyzed the main technologies used specifically in the development of GIS , and we identified typical errors a programmer can introduce during the development .	we
In order to apply these operators to a SUT , [MASK] rely on Java reflection and aspect - oriented programming .	we
[MASK] allows us to obtain the list of classes and methods of the SUT , so the user can decide the methods to wish the operators will be applied .	Reflection
Later , [MASK] capture information about the methods of the SUT to be mutated , together with the information of the mutation operators that were already defined .	we
From these data , [MASK] generate the mutation operator , in the form of on aspect , which will then be possible to interweave with the SUT which generates a mutant of the SUT .	we
Next , [MASK] describe the definition of two operators and two cases of application on real - world GIS applications .	we
[MASK] exchanges the coordinate system of a geometry , so it does not match the coordinate system that is being used in the user interface .	It
[MASK] simulates the error of not checking that the coordinate system is correct .	It
This [MASK] allows registering places of interest for the user .	application
By creating a Geofence with an erroneous location from its central location , the [MASK] will receive incorrect location notifications .	device
As a result , the [MASK] will see in the application ’s map viewer the Geofences drawn in erroneous zones ( Figure 1 ) .	user
[MASK] introduces errors in the processing of geometries , manipulating the result of the operations that carry out the verification of different topological restrictions between geometries , such as intersects , covers or overlap .	It
This [MASK] causes the incorrect display of the resulting geometry that should be drawn in the user interface after the operation applied to the two initial geometries ( Figure 2 ) .	error
In existing proposals , [MASK] can find both generic and specific mutation operators .	we
However , [MASK] are not adequate to cover errors in particular domains .	these
[MASK] have defined new operators specific to the GIS domain and a way to apply them to a SUT .	We
In addition , [MASK] have tested the operators defined in two GIS applications .	we
As future work , [MASK] intend to extend this approach to other domains , as well as to use the developed operators for the automatic improvement of sets of test cases .	we
When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study , replication [MASK] serve to test the reliability of the previous study ’s findings .	studies
When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study , [MASK] serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions .	they
Beyond these calls , [MASK] to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged .	efforts
The Open Science [MASK] ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin & Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) .	Framework
In some fields , a flourishing [MASK] , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel & Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) .	metascience
The driving [MASK] behind this battery of calls , commentaries , infrastructure , and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research .	force
The severe [MASK] underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken .	concerns
These [MASK] speak to the very core of science , raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work .	concerns
Indeed , some [MASK] have called replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , & Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) .	commentators
In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , [MASK] might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now .	one
However , a perceived [MASK] of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez - Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , & Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) , and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .	lack
The current [MASK] begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews .	study
The narrative [MASK] considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline .	review
To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research , the systematic [MASK] provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self - labeled as replications .	review
Finally , [MASK] offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite ( Morgan - Short et al. , 2018 ) 1 and single site ( Faretta - Stutenberg & Morgan - Short , 2011 ; Marsden , Williams , & Liu , 2013 ; McManus & Marsden , 2017 ; Morgan - Short , Heil , Botero - Moriaty , & Ebert , 2012 ) replications .	we
[MASK] start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory , at least for hypothesis - testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable .	We
[MASK] is one of the most important marine parameters , which controls many processes such as physical circulations , biogeochemistry dynamics from regional to global ocean [ 1 , 2 ] .	Salinity
In the past decade , with the successful launch of the soil moisture and ocean salinity ( SMOS ) satellite by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) [ 3 ] , the Aquarius / SAC-D satellite [ 4 ] , and the soil moisture active passive ( SMAP ) satellite [ 5 , 6 ] by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , global sea surface salinity ( SSS ) [MASK] from space have become possible and a significant improvement has been made to understand the ocean dynamics and climate change .	observations
At the end of 1990 , two airborne microwave [MASK] , the electronically scanned thinned array radiometer ( ESTAR ) and the scanning low - frequency microwave radiometer ( SLFMR ) , successfully produced SSS maps in coastal areas in agreement with in - situ measurements with an accuracy of about 1 psu .	interferometers
However , the [MASK] of satellite measured brightness temperature to SSS is quite low .	sensitivity
For example , the [MASK] of vertically polarized brightness temperature to SSS variation is 0.4 to 0.8 K/psu for different observing angles and sea surface temperatures ( SST ) , and it is only 0.2 to 0.6 K/psu for the horizontal polarization brightness temperature [ 10 ] .	sensitivity
Thus , remote [MASK] of SSS requires a highly accurate retrieval model .	sensing
Besides the atmospheric effects , the [MASK] of sea surface emissivity due to the sea surface roughness and foam effects is the main source of error , which could significantly hamper the accuracy of SSS retrieval [ 11 ] .	increasing
Although many theoretical and empirical models have been developed , some [MASK] are still unsolved .	problems
For example , the [MASK] originally proposed to estimate brightness temperature at higher frequencies , uses the sea surface wave spectrum by multiplying a factor of 2 .	TSM
Moreover , the sea surface [MASK] of downwelling atmospheric emission is another contribution to satellite - observed brightness temperature [ 31 ] , thus the determination of the cutoff wavenumber is required not only for sea surface emission but also for reflection .	reflection
In addition , the widely used empirical [MASK] decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects , which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind - roughened sea surface .	models
Thus , the [MASK] of these models in coastal area of China needs to be assessed and tested in order to achieve higher accuracies of SSS from the space - borne observations .	compatibility
[MASK] have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens , consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .	We
The posterior [MASK] of the CoM produced a more vertically oriented femur during standing ( femur in experimental animals was 40 % more vertical than control subjects ) , and increased femoral retraction and decreased knee flexion during walking .	displacement
These [MASK] indicate a shift from the standard bird , knee - driven bipedal locomotion to a more hip - driven locomotion , typical of crocodilians ( the only other extant archosaur group ) , mammals , and hypothetically , bipedal non-avian dinosaurs .	results
In fact , the control - weight [MASK] showed a more horizontally oriented femur during walking with respect to the control group , similar to that observed in Carrano and Biewener 's experimental subjects [ 7 ] .	subjects
Therefore , [MASK] conclude that the location of the CoM can be a key factor in defining limb posture and kinematics .	we
Our [MASK] show that for a given CFL mass , femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures .	data
[MASK] in limb orientation can produce substantial differences in loading regimes on limb bones .	Differences
The [MASK] of each limb element to the ground reaction force ( GRF ) indicates the relative contribution of axial and bending forces to external bone loading : a bone perpendicular to the GRF is expected experience greater bending forces than one parallel to the GRF .	orientation
[MASK] have relatively shorter , stouter femora than non-avian theropods , presumed to be associated with more horizontal orientation .	Birds
Experimental [MASK] of femoral orientation in chickens suggest that torsional loads increase as the femur becomes more horizontal [ 7 ] supporting the idea that postural differences could be reflected in differences in limb cross-sectional geometry .	manipulations
To test if the postural differences observed in this study produced changes in limb morphology , [MASK] measured the length and mid-shaft cross-sectional properties of the femur in all our individuals .	we
However , [MASK] found no differences in cross-sectional femoral geometry among groups .	we
Maybe [MASK] is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [ 24 ] , suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution .	this
Interestingly , femur [MASK] tended to be greater in the experimental group than in both the control - weight and the control group ( by 4 and 7 % , respectively ) , although not signifcant .	length
If this were the case , [MASK] would support the idea that non-avian theropods have relatively thinner femora than extant birds because of postural differences [ 6 ] .	it
[MASK] suggest that the different outcomes are due to the distinct rearing and exercising conditions used in each study , in addition to the different artificial tails used .	We
First , our experimental [MASK] lived in a large enclosure under conditions that allowed them to exercise all day long .	subjects
During avian evolution , the [MASK] of the CFL and reorganization of the pelvic musculature [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] could have made birds unable to properly carry a postacetabular mass equivalent to that carried by non-avian theropods [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .	loss
In our experimental setup , [MASK] attempted to more closely mimic non-avian theropod tail morphology , in which mass is distributed through a distally tapering tail .	we
In addition , [MASK] reduced the total tail mass to 15 % body mass from the 20 % body mass used by Carrano and Biewener .	we
Thus , our [MASK] seems to have generated a more gradual and less pronounced change in the moment of inertia produced by the artificial tail , allowing experimental subjects to adjust to the posterior mass by adopting a more vertical position of the femur while standing .	study
Interestingly , the femur [MASK] during walking in our control - weight group resembles the results reported in the experimental subjects of Carrano and Biewener .	kinematics
[MASK] suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the CoM .	This
However , substantial [MASK] in hindlimb morphology between these groups make difficult to assess the validity of inferences obtained from such studies .	differences
One caveat , however , is that our [MASK] uses tail reduction as the mechanism for CoM displacement despite it has been recently shown that the evolutionary change in CoM position was driven instead by forelimb enlargement [ 8 ] .	approach
Nonetheless , [MASK] does not mean that tail reduction had no effect on CoM displacement , but that it was not the most important factor .	this
Ideally [MASK] would have increased tail mass and reduced pectoral limb mass but , unfortunately , this is not experimentally feasible .	we
[MASK] argue that our experimental approach , although not perfect , was effective in displacing the CoM and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods .	We
Thus , [MASK] expect that careful phenotypic manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics , providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution .	we
[MASK] is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 ) and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) , in which media - hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production .	it
Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) , [MASK] has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28 - city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan - based creations .	it
As such , the Game of Thrones [MASK] represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new , who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives .	storyworld
In this sense , [MASK] of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored .	fans
Transmedia [MASK] , like that exemplified by Game of Thrones , are becoming increasingly prevalent ( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ; these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge of managing the fire - hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society .	systems
The [MASK] of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies , by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information - user .	study
As a first step in defining the “ transmedia fan ” , the current [MASK] undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans .	project
[MASK] of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” , while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .	Readers
Since the television series ’ inception , [MASK] at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode :	writers
[MASK] results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ” which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads :	What
As a pilot project , the current [MASK] takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory ( Charmaz , 2006 ) .	work
Through this analysis , a [MASK] of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans .	categorization
These [MASK] fall under two broad categories :	themes
A [MASK] of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model , or models , of the “ transmedia fan ” .	comparison
The present [MASK] represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems , as exemplified by Game of Thrones , through the study of fans .	research
The [MASK] posed by this research is , fundamentally , an examination of how the problem of “ access ” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer .	question
Future [MASK] should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice , in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern - day consumers .	research
The current [MASK] will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan .	study
This [MASK] is of relevance to researchers in media studies , fan studies , information studies and digital humanities .	project
[MASK] Bernoulli FRS ( German pronunciation : [ bɛʁˈnʊli ] ; 8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family .	Daniel
The Bernoulli [MASK] came originally from Antwerp , at that time in the Spanish Netherlands , but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots .	family
After a brief period in Frankfurt the [MASK] moved to Basel , in Switzerland .	family
[MASK] was a son of Johann Bernoulli ( one of the " early developers " of calculus ) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli ( who " was the first to discover the theory of probability " ) .	Daniel
[MASK] had two brothers , Niklaus and Johann II .	He
Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris , [MASK] , unable to bear the " shame " of being compared Daniel 's equal , banned Daniel from his house .	Johann
[MASK] Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel 's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica .	Johann
Despite Daniel 's attempts at reconciliation , his [MASK] carried the grudge until his death .	father
Around schooling age , his [MASK] , Johann , encouraged him to study business , there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician .	father
However , [MASK] refused , because he wanted to study mathematics .	Daniel
[MASK] later gave in to his father 's wish and studied business .	He
His [MASK] then asked him to study in medicine , and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately , which they continued for some time .	father
[MASK] studied medicine at Basel , Heidelberg , and Strasbourg , and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721 .	Daniel
[MASK] was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler .	He
[MASK] went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics , but was very unhappy there , and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg .	He
[MASK] returned to the University of Basel , where he successively held the chairs of medicine , metaphysics , and natural philosophy until his death .	He
His earliest mathematical [MASK] was the Exercitationes ( Mathematical Exercises ) , published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach .	work
Two years later [MASK] pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation .	he
His chief [MASK] is Hydrodynamica , published in 1738 ;	work
[MASK] resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange 's Mécanique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle , namely , conservation of energy .	it
[MASK] also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions , especially on problems connected with vibrating strings , and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert .	Bernoulli
Together [MASK] and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids .	Bernoulli
In particular , [MASK] wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure .	they
To investigate this , [MASK] experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid 's pressure in the pipe .	Daniel
Soon [MASK] all over Europe were measuring patients ' blood pressure by sticking point - ended glass tubes directly into their arteries .	physicians
Taking his discoveries further , [MASK] Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy .	Daniel
[MASK] realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure .	Daniel
A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the [MASK] falls .	pressure
The [MASK] in this area is lower than that under the wing , so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing .	pressure

[MASK] J. Fillmore ( August 9 , 1929 – February 13 , 2014 ) was an American linguist and Professor of Linguistics at the University of California , Berkeley .	Charles
[MASK] received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan in 1961 .	He
[MASK] spent ten years at The Ohio State University and a year as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University before joining Berkeley 's Department of Linguistics in 1971 . [ 1 ]	Fillmore
[MASK] was extremely influential in the areas of syntax and lexical semantics .	Fillmore
[MASK] received the 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Computational Linguistics . [ 3 ]	Fillmore
[MASK] died in 2014 . [ 4 ]	He
[MASK] spent three years in the U.S. Army stationed in Japan , where he intercepted coded Russian conversations on short - wave radio and taught himself Japanese . [ 2 ]	Fillmore
Following his discharge , [MASK] taught English at a Buddhist girls ' school while also taking classes at Kyoto University .	he
[MASK] returned to the US , receiving his doctorate at the University of Michigan and then teaching at The Ohio State University in Columbus .	He
At the time , [MASK] was still a proponent of Noam Chomsky 's theory of generative grammar during its earliest transformational grammar phase .	he
In 1963 , his seminal [MASK] The position of embedding transformations in a Grammar introduced the transformational cycle .	article
This [MASK] has been a foundational insight for theories of syntax since that time .	principle
By 1965 , [MASK] had come to acknowledge that semantics plays a crucial role in grammar . [ 6 ]	Fillmore
In 1968 , [MASK] published his theory of Case Grammar ( Fillmore 1968 ) , which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants .	he
An [MASK] can have an agent , a patient , purposes , locations , and so on .	action
Following his move to the University of California , Berkeley , in 1971 , this [MASK] eventually evolved into a broader cognitive linguistic theory called Frame Semantics ( 1976 ) .	theory
A commercial [MASK] , for instance , crucially involved elements such as a seller , a buyer , some good , and some money .	event
Around the same time , Fillmore 's Santa Cruz [MASK] on Deixis , delivered in 1971 and published in 1975 , contributed to establishing the field of linguistic pragmatics , which studies the relationship between linguistic form and the context of utterance . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]	Lectures
In all of this research , [MASK] illuminated the fundamental importance of semantics , and its role in motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena .	he
This [MASK] aimed at developing a complete theory of grammar that would fully acknowledge the role of semantics right from the start , while simultaneously adopting constraint - based formalisms as popular in computer science and natural language processing .	work
This [MASK] built on the notion of construction from traditional and pedagogical grammars rather than the rule - based formalisms that dominate most of generative grammar .	theory
[MASK] of Fillmore 's most widely noticed works of the time ( with Paul Kay and Cathy O'Connor ) appeared in ' Language ' in 1988 as " Regularity and Idiomaticity in Grammatical Constructions : The Case of Let Alone " .	One
Their [MASK] highlighted the merits of such a theory of by focusing on the ' let alone ' construction .	paper
Over time , construction [MASK] developed into a research area of its own , and a number of variants have been proposed over the years by different researchers .	grammar
The first [MASK] of “ Cognitive Linguistics ” by Cruse and Croft ( 2004 ) , for instance , begins with a summary of Fillmore 's work .	chapter
[MASK] served as President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1991 and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2000 . [ 7 ]	Fillmore
His [MASK] continues with his many notable students , including Adele Goldberg , Laura Michaelis , Christopher Johnson , Miriam R. L. Petruck , Len Talmy , and Eve Sweetser .	legacy
In the 1990s , [MASK] taught classes in computational lexicography at the University of Pisa , where he met Sue Atkins , who was conducting frame - semantic analyses from a lexicographic perspective .	Fillmore
In their subsequent discussions and collaborations , [MASK] came to acknowledge the importance of considering corpus data . [ 2 ]	Fillmore
[MASK] discussed the " dictionary of the future " , in which every word would be linked to example sentences from corpora . [ 7 ] [ 9 ]	They
After 23 years at the University of California , Berkeley , [MASK] retired in 1994 and joined Berkeley 's International Computer Science Institute . [ 6 ]	Fillmore
There , [MASK] started a project called FrameNet , an on - line structured description of the English lexicon implementing much of what he had earlier proposed more theoretically in his theory of Frame semantics , while implementing the idea of emphasizing example sentences from corpora .	he
[MASK] Poisson reviewed Galois ' paper on equation theory and declared it " incomprehensible " .	Siméon
[MASK] returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale , although he continued to spend time in political activities .	Galois
After his expulsion became official in January 1831 , [MASK] attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest , but this waned , as it seemed that his political activism had priority . [ 4 ] [ 7 ]	he
[MASK] Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 .	Siméon
Around 4 July 1831 , [MASK] declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ]	Poisson
While Poisson 's report was made before Galois ' July 14 arrest , [MASK] took until October to reach Galois in prison .	it
Apparently , however , [MASK] did not ignore Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ]	Galois
Galois ' fatal [MASK] took place on 30 May . [ 17 ]	duel
The true [MASK] behind the duel are obscure .	motives
What is known is that five days before his death , [MASK] wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair . [ 7 ]	he
Some archival [MASK] on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie - Félicie Poterin du Motel , [ 18 ] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life .	investigation
[MASK] of letters from her , copied by Galois himself ( with many portions , such as her name , either obliterated or deliberately omitted ) , are available . [ 19 ]	Fragments
The [MASK] hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois , and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf .	letters
Galois ' [MASK] , Gabriel Demante , when asked if he knew the cause of the duel , mentioned that Galois " found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé , each of whom provoked the duel . "	cousin
[MASK] himself famously exclaimed : " I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes . " [ 12 ]	Galois
As to his opponent in the duel , [MASK] Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville , [ 13 ] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois ' first arrest . [ 20 ]	Alexandre
However , [MASK] is alone in this assertion , and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved .	Dumas
On the other hand , extant newspaper [MASK] from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D. " ) that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois ' Republican friends , most probably Ernest Duchatelet , who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges . [ 21 ]	clippings
[MASK] Hermann Weyl said of this testament , " This letter , if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains , is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind . "	Mathematician
However , the [MASK] of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated . [ 7 ]	legend
In these final papers , [MASK] outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers .	he

[MASK] then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors :	Nida

[MASK] of Tabennese ( c. 314 – 368 ) , also known as Abba Theodorus and Theodore the Sanctified was the spiritual successor to Pachomius and played a crucial role in preventing the first Christian cenobitic monastic federation from collapsing after the death of its founder .	Theodorus
Early in life [MASK] denied the excesses of his parents , and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne , near the modern town of Esna , Egypt .	he
A [MASK] from Theodorus ’ monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne .	brother
Praying and weeping , [MASK] became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius .	Theodorus
Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background , [MASK] opted to follow the visiting monk , and his persistence ( and lack of obedience ) paid off .	Theodorus
Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius , [MASK] lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery , and took on the title of the " brothers ’ comforter " .	Theodorus
[MASK] asserted his influence openly ( which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius ) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years , despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy .	Theodorus
Finally , [MASK] called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth , and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built .	Pachomius
Retiring to the monastery of Phbow , [MASK] gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese , though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus ’ watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand .	Pachomius
Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery , [MASK] became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years .	Theodorus
Despite his clear potential and popularity , [MASK] refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority ; though the old man 's failing health soon changed things forever .	Pachomius
After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion , [MASK] became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death .	Pachomius
[MASK] had not named a successor , and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died .	Pachomius
Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world 's glory , [MASK] consented .	he
Unfortunately for the would - be leader , [MASK] recovered , and upon hearing of Theodorus ’ decision , exiled the ambitious young man .	Pachomius
After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude , [MASK] forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more .	Pachomius
[MASK] returned , though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former protégé .	Normalcy
In 348 [MASK] died , naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus .	Pachomius
The [MASK] of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge , and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum .	death
Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia , [MASK] soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader .	problems
Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader , [MASK] of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios .	many
The [MASK] of monasteries was falling apart , and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels .	federation
Soon after his arrival , [MASK] was the new de facto leader , though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios .	Theodorus
For eighteen years [MASK] administered from Pachomius ’ old headquarters in Phbow , using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors , such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks .	Theodorus
Within a few months his [MASK] came true , and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority . [ 1 ]	prediction
By now [MASK] 'm sure you 're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here , but first , I would like to talk to you about these three items .	I
[MASK] have here , some ice in a pan , water in this glass , and steam rising from this pot .	I
Now , [MASK] would like to ask you , how these three things .	I
How are [MASK] all alike .	they
[MASK] are all forms of water .	They
This [MASK] here of course is water , I told you there was water in this glass , and you have all seen water boil at home , so you are familiar with steam .	ice
And the [MASK] of this water here , the ice , is , about uh twenty - four – woo- nineteen degrees .	temperature
The [MASK] of this w- water here , is sixty - four degrees , the temperature of this steam , is , I know it 's hotter than that .	temperature
Yeah , [MASK] 's about a hundred and eleven degrees .	it
Oh , and by the way guys , what do [MASK] call something that 's hard , like this ice here , or a table , or a rock ?	we
[MASK] call it a ?	We
You should g- — [MASK] should be a choir .	you
[MASK] should go out on the road there , like , yeah .	You
[MASK] are .	We
Y- — oh well , [MASK] 'm glad to meet you .	I
Of course [MASK] call it a sholids .	we
And a [MASK] has one shape .	solid
And what do [MASK] call something that you — that you can splish splash ?	we
[MASK] 're not gon na let me finish , are you ?	You
Yes , [MASK] call it a ?	we
And a [MASK] can change its shape , to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in .	liquid
And finally , what do [MASK] call something that 's loose , and floating around like this steam here ?	we
Or a cloud , or the air we breathe , [MASK] call it a ?	we
And a [MASK] completely fills whatever shape container you put it in .	gas
And so , how do [MASK] get water to change , from a solid , to a liquid , to a gas , and back and forth ?	you
[MASK] like the way he expressed that .	I
Never before have [MASK] heard it , add or subtract energy , or , heat , change the temperature , basically .	I
Well folks , now [MASK] 'm going to show you something else that happens when you change the temperature , and that 's where these balloons come in .	I
[MASK] have here a number of balloons , but , l- let 's see how many of these balloons , I can fit , into this little itty - bitty container here .	I
[MASK] would be ...	This
[MASK] think , well , okay , w- th- th- , I 'm glad I never saw d- Citizen Kane with you .	You
[MASK] is a sled .	Rosebud
One [MASK] going into the little container here .	balloon
And [MASK] would be ...	this
Two [MASK] going into the little container here .	balloons
Ah , [MASK] 're not fitting in so easily .	they
So hopefully [MASK] can fit all balloons into this little container here .	I
And [MASK] would be ?	this
Three [MASK] going onto the the little container there .	balloons
And now , [MASK] would be ?	this
[MASK] 's four .	It
Boy you [MASK] did n't watch enough Sesame Street as a child .	people
[MASK] would be ?	This
And [MASK] would be ?	this
In Spanish [MASK] would be ?	it
[MASK] 'm afraid for our nation .	I
Okay , well , and [MASK] would be ?	this
And finally , [MASK] would be ?	this
[MASK] thought you were telling me your breakfast .	I
Oh my gosh , eight [MASK] into this little container here , I bet you 're wondering r- how that happened .	balloons
[MASK] popped two .	You
[MASK] slowed down the molecules ,	You
Well – la duh dah dih duh duh , [MASK] 're getting a little ahead of me son .	you
So [MASK] do n't need to go borrow equipment from anybody , to to do the feet ?	you
Well , [MASK] 're gon na have to find somewhere , to get , something	we
[MASK] 'm gon na	I
[MASK] 're not gon na do the feet today , I 'm gon na wait till like , early in the morning , to do those , cause y- I mean you get so tired .	We
N- you just , [MASK] takes well , it takes me longer than most people , cause you know , I 'm not as strong and , and I 'm not as good , as like somebody that would do it all the time .	it
[MASK] know .	You
I mean , oh I mean [MASK] trim horses , and stuff like that , but I mean , I 'm not like , I 'm not uh , .	I
[MASK] do n't know how to say it .	I
But [MASK] know , they do it for a living .	you
[MASK] know , most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time .	You
And [MASK] 'm not that good or , and I 'm not very strong .	I
Did [MASK] train you —	they
Did [MASK] train you that —	they
So [MASK] have your own equipment , but —	you
[MASK] do n't have my own equipment at all .	I
[MASK] , you know , has done some of it .	Dad
That 's another thing too , is [MASK] kinda had a b- general idea , of kinda how to do it , just watching him .	I
And , [MASK] do n't know .	I
Then , down there , um , [MASK] 's mandatory .	it
You have to — to graduate , you know , or well , to get the degree , you know , [MASK] have to take this class .	you
And you can only take — if you want to , [MASK] can only take it for eight weeks .	you
And , if you wan na go on in it , you n- — then , [MASK] can go on .	you
[MASK] know .	You
And [MASK] decided to go ahead and go on in it .	I
And the first part of it , is like , well [MASK] have lecture , then we have lab .	we
And like , the first part of it , [MASK] just go into the classroom , and he like ...	we
I mean , it — that 's just kinda how [MASK] happens , you know , because he kinda has to tell you ...	it
[MASK] go over the whole , the whole part of the horse .	They
Yeah , [MASK] bet .	I
And then , so [MASK] had to know these tendons , and ligaments , and then , all the bones , and , you know , all the way up – from the shoulder down , and then from the hip down .	we
[MASK] know ?	You
And then there — and then [MASK] can see this little white line ?	you
And that 's kinda where [MASK] go by , to —	you
You know , the [MASK] kinda helps you out , because it , has that little white line right there .	horse
And that 's where [MASK] kinda — kinda need a little guide , of where you trim .	you
And , [MASK] am still scared to do it .	I
Because , you know , I mean , [MASK] can make a horse go lame , by doing it .	you
Well [MASK] can trim em too short .	you
[MASK] 's not bad , but sometimes you can get it really bad .	That
[MASK] can really make a horse really bad .	You
And [MASK] m-	they
You know then , [MASK] have to , like , keep em , away from anything , you know , get em really in the soft ground , and , no hard pebbles , or hard clods of dirt or anything ?	they
So , [MASK] do n't know .	I
[MASK] 'm a little scared about doing it yet .	I
You know , [MASK] get em really long .	I
I mean [MASK] 're still long , when I get done with them .	they
A lot of times , like , [MASK] 'll get done , and I 'll think I 'm done , and I 'll look at – look down at the horse 's hoof , and it 's still , it 's too long .	I
And then like , [MASK] would never , ever , ever , trust myself , to shoe a horse .	I
We did — [MASK] did a lot of stuff .	we
We did a lot of stuff with the — like [MASK] had the , um , the burners ?	we
You know , and you 'd put the — you 'd have — [MASK] started out with the straight iron ?	you
[MASK] know ?	You
And [MASK] 'd stick it into the , into the , you know like , actual blacksmithing .	you
And [MASK] 'd put it into the hot coals , you know ?	you
And then , [MASK] 'd — I I – straight bar .	we
And [MASK] 'd make it a — a horseshoe out of it , you know ?	we
But , these shoes [MASK] never did put on a horse .	we
[MASK] just put the shoes that were already made , on a horse .	We
And [MASK] 's as far as we got .	that
I mean , if [MASK] would really get into it , well as a matter of fact , this is really funny .	you
[MASK] 're really —	They
Which we , [MASK] had it in another class too .	we
We — [MASK] was kind of a double thing that , we had in — in another class , so it was kinda review for us .	that
Well [MASK] was a review for some people , depending on what time of the year you took it .	it
[MASK] know .	You
If [MASK] was a review or not .	it
But , anyway , um , what was [MASK] gon na say ?	I
[MASK] forgot what I was think- —	I
[MASK] said you never made the horseshoes .	You
[MASK] 're round .	They
[MASK] pick out a size .	We
You know [MASK] 'd like look at the horse 's hoof , and say , okay , this is a double - aught .	we
[MASK] is an aught .	This
[MASK] is , you know .	This
And double - [MASK] and aught , are the ones that are most popular .	aught
You know , I mean , [MASK] get into the big horses , the — like the Clydesdales , Shires , that 's a d- — a whole different thing .	you
Or ponies , [MASK] 's a whole different thing .	that
But [MASK] 're talking just the regular , light horses you know .	we
[MASK] 's to Judy .	That
[MASK] probably have one like it already .	You
[MASK] do n't know .	I
[MASK] do n't know .	I

Uh , [MASK] can —	she

So , [MASK] 'll just wait , on ours .	we
Now [MASK] can open that .	you
Okay , the next [MASK] will be uh , Mitchell Roberts , versus , uh , Matthew Collins , ABC Builders Interiors ?	case
This — both [MASK] are here ?	sides
[MASK] 's Mitchell Roberts ?	Who
[MASK] 's the party being s- served ?	Who
[MASK] are ?	You
And [MASK] brought an action , against uh Matthew Collins , for um , roughly seven - hundred dollars , for labor installing a carpet .	you
So [MASK] went out and looked at the job —	I
Okay , you run a — you run a a carpet business [MASK] presume ?	I
[MASK] 'm a licensed contractor .	I
Um , the [MASK] was out at UCSB , I went and estimated the job for myself , to see if I could take the job , for what he wanted to pay for it , and I let him know that I could not .	job
[MASK] would n't make any money .	I
So uh , upon me telling him that , [MASK] offered to pay my employees , fill out — he had em fill out W2 forms all of em , and he paid em , to lessen the burden of payment on me , so that I in turn would make more money off the job .	he
[MASK] agreed to that , after about —	I
Ca- is [MASK] a normal procedure ?	that
[MASK] wanted me to do the job , so he offered to take some of the monetary burden off my back , so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gon na do it on .	He
So in other words , your — your [MASK] would really be his employees for the purpose of this job .	helpers
[MASK] 's correct .	That
[MASK] had em all fill out the plo- proper forms .	He
[MASK] 's correct .	That
Uh , [MASK] went to receive my check , of which , we had agreed that he would deduct the amount of the hourly wage , that he was —	I
Was this [MASK] in writing , or verbal ?	agreement
[MASK] 've been working with him for like six years .	I
So [MASK] approached him with it , and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here , and noted that , what the employees made , and uh , at twenty - six percent less deduction on these two employees .	I
[MASK] was the employer contribution .	Which
So [MASK] noted to him that he was supposed to pay that , he said , uh n- , no , you 're gon na pay it .	I
So [MASK] said that 's not as per our agreement , he said yes it is , he handed me my check , rolled up his window , and drove off .	I
And [MASK] 's there to state , he 's — he saw that , and was witness to that .	he
[MASK] have a letter —	I
I do n- [MASK] do n't think it 's relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off .	I
Well , [MASK] know .	I
But , that – [MASK] was the end of our thing , I tried to contact him everything , finally I uh contacted my attorney .	that
[MASK] 'd like to present this letter to you here .	I
If [MASK] may look at that ?	I
And , have [MASK] shown that to uh Mr. Collins ?	you
He has — [MASK] has received a copy of that letter .	he
Now [MASK] Roberts is an attorney .	Stu
Is [MASK] correct ?	that
[MASK] 're uh —	You
[MASK] 'm his nephew .	I
[MASK] 're his nephew .	You
And [MASK] 're Nick Ro- Roberts ' nephew too then .	you
[MASK] 's correct .	That
So uh your [MASK] then wrote uh Builders uh a letter , that 's what I 'm reading now .	uncle
Uh [MASK] do emphasize that I 'm reading it , this is not evidence , this is only y- your story , that you 've told Mr. Roberts .	I
[MASK] 's correct , that 's correct .	That
So really the [MASK] then boils down to this twenty - six percent .	dispute
[MASK] 's it sir .	That
[MASK] 's the reason why I had him fill out that portion of , or he wanted to write those checks , was so I would save that money , so I would do that job .	That
Mr. Collins [MASK] know you 're biting at the bit there , you wan na say something , so why do n't you go ahead .	I
Um , uh pretty much , um , [MASK] Mitchell has stated is untrue .	what
[MASK] , uh did do some work for me out at the college , we did the Anacapa Residential Hall .	Mitchell
And [MASK] is a , eight - thousand - yard job , that we did this summer .	this
[MASK] required us to , employ , oh five or six crews , uh Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used , on the job .	It
Uh [MASK] expressed a desire to do the work out there , he expressed , he did not know how to handle the payroll .	Mitchell
[MASK] of the , uh , contractors here in town , that are independents like Mitchell , do n't know how to do prevailing wage statements .	Most
The [MASK] is a state - funded uh uh remodel , and on state - funded remodels , we 're required to pay prevailing wages .	college
And so , uh a [MASK] of the crews , uh , like Mitchell , who have people that work under him , around town , in regular situations , come to the people like me , and ask us to do payroll for them .	lot
When we do the payroll for them , [MASK] state to them up front , that uh , we will pay the payroll , we will make the deductions , and then the employer contribution , which is approximately twenty - six percent , over and above the hourly wage , is also deducted , from the um subcontractor 's check .	we
Now this uh th- twenty - six percent , [MASK] 'd be be social security .	that
And what else would [MASK] include ?	it
[MASK] 's anything above that .	That
Well you have — you have — you have that — [MASK] have a breakdown here , of what we paid Mitchell 's men , if you 'd like to see that .	I
I mean , do — yeah , y- [MASK] got a total of uh , seven point six five percent employer contributions on the —	you
Um , [MASK] explains it pretty well , there 's quite a few deductions , of course —	that
So [MASK] laid the the — laid the egg , which Luther hatched .	Erasmus
And um , when [MASK] come then , to , uh , however this debate .	you
Um , [MASK] think uh , let me read you a page from Brendler .	I
Because [MASK] sets the sa- stage very nicely .	it
[MASK] is in the Luther book some of you are reading , and um , if you , this evening when you go home , if you wan na meditate it on more , on – on it more , it 's on page three eleven .	This
[MASK] 's on page three eleven .	It
[MASK] was glad to take up the theme of this debate .	Luther
And [MASK] is what Luther writes to Erasmus .	this
[MASK] alone , among all the others , have recognized the key question .	You
And [MASK] do not bore me , with the Papacy , purgatory , indulgences , and similar nonsense .	you
[MASK] , and you alone , have identified that on which all else hinges .	You
And [MASK] have put the razor to the throat .	you
And for that [MASK] thank you heartily .	I
Um , thus [MASK] evalu- uh evaluated the subject .	Luther
And [MASK] commented on the significance of their engagement , in battle , in his own style .	Erasmus
And [MASK] wrote to Luther .	he
Perhaps an [MASK] who writes against you , will do more for the Gospel , than certain dunderheads who support you .	Erasmus
And then , humanistic [MASK] , will never consent .	thinking
[MASK] is Brendler now , obs- – uh on this uh , but this sets the stage for what we 're gon na talk about .	This
Humanistic [MASK] will never consent to the doctrine of original sin .	thinking
[MASK] de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin .	Pico
[MASK] am the master of my fate ,	I
[MASK] am the captain of my soul .	I
[MASK] do n't think that he would acknowledge original sin .	I
And that apart from grace alone , free [MASK] is nothing , can do nothing , does nothing , except depraved deeds .	will
Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based , and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system , [MASK] do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man- – dignity of man .	they
[MASK] , and semi-pelagianism , with all of its emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace , finally views free will as the decisive factor in attaining salvation , thereby conceptualizing free will , as similar to a healthy man- – healthy human understanding .	Catholic
For how can a [MASK] , be responsible for his deeds , if he possesses no free will ?	person
[MASK] is what Erasmus asked .	This
How can [MASK] decide between good and evil ?	he
Such [MASK] , long known to Luther , and many times presented to him , impressed him not in the least .	arguments
[MASK] alone is salvation .	God
[MASK] alone measures guilt .	God
[MASK] alone condemns .	He
[MASK] alone grants grace .	He
[MASK] can do nothing against the divine prerogative .	Man
[MASK] can only accept the divine judgment .	Man
[MASK] is in fact best .	This
For [MASK] alone is infallible , and his being is grace and mercy .	God
This [MASK] , that man is divinely elected to salvation , or to damnation , is the center of the predestination dogma , that later , the Geneva reformer Calvin , made the center of his teaching , and that subsequently , under other historical preconditions and circumstances , could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class , in the Netherlands , and in England .	concept
[MASK] is the paragraph though .	This
Therefore , [MASK] did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine .	Luther
Such [MASK] , on the contrary , necessarily appeared to Luther , given his theological orientation , as suspicious , from the very start , because they originated from human nature , which exalted itself against God .	arguments
The [MASK] reason prefers to submit to the Devil , adjusts to all situations , and proves everything , that is demanded of her .	whore
Human [MASK] , does not possess free will .	nature
[MASK] is like a horse , ridden by God or the Devil .	It
The [MASK] possesses the will .	rider
The [MASK] obeys .	horse
Well [MASK] 's as clear as you can get it .	that
Human [MASK] is like a horse , ridden by God or the Devil .	nature
The [MASK] possesses free will .	rider
The [MASK] obeys .	horse
And as you come — as Erasmus comes to this , [MASK] 's going to say , well let 's look at the Scriptures .	he
Now , number one , [MASK] have to admit first – v- first off , that there seem to be passages , there are passages in the Scriptures .	we
[MASK] seem to teach , that man is responsible for his deeds , and that he may act , and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God .	Which
Is n't [MASK] clear in the Scriptures ?	that
[MASK] will may come .	Whosoever
Um , [MASK] turned to his disciples , you remember , when some deserted him , and seemed , because they were disappointed in some of his sayings , and they were offended by some of the things he said , and they walked no longer with him it said .	Jesus
And then [MASK] turned to those who remained , and he said , will ye also go away ?	he
[MASK] had a choice .	They
Will [MASK] go away ?	you
What do [MASK] will ?	you
And the [MASK] , apparently was , re- resided in in these disciples .	will
And so [MASK] is going to say , so obviously , in Scripture we have paradox .	Erasmus
[MASK] have clear passages of Scripture , which seem to indicate that man has a free will , and that he can exercise that will , to follow , or not to follow .	We
On the other hand , [MASK] have passages of Scripture , which seem to indicate , that the will is not free , and that the – , and that man i- th- is – man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God .	we
Do [MASK] have any kids ?	they
Have [MASK] been married a long time ?	they
[MASK] do n't think Kathy can have kids , she 's got a bad back .	I
[MASK] sounds bad to me .	It
She could n't – [MASK] could n't carry Laura .	she
She had to be – Laura – [MASK] could hold her .	She
Yeah sh- [MASK] weighed all of ten pounds you know .	she
[MASK] 's all , heavy .	She
[MASK] could –	She
Well , maybe [MASK] does have quite a problem .	she
Some [MASK] d- could .	people
[MASK] suppose .	I
I mean , [MASK] 's not impossible .	it
How long have [MASK] been married ?	they
[MASK] think , and , two years in November .	I
What 's [MASK] doing now ?	Bill
What are [MASK] in the process of ?	we
Um , yesterday [MASK] was a carpenter .	he
[MASK] was a carpenter ?	He
Yeah [MASK] put a floor in a barn .	he
[MASK] put a floor in a barn .	He
Well , [MASK] just fixed it , it had had one , and he was just replacing old rotten board .	he
[MASK] do n't know what he 's doing today .	I
What does [MASK] do when he does n't take his lunch , come home ?	he
No [MASK] feeds him .	Doris
Would [MASK] feed him every day ?	she
[MASK] do n't understand what not taking his lunch has to do with baling hay .	I
Well if he was gon na bale hay , [MASK] would n't come in for lunch .	they
[MASK] would just eat –	They
While [MASK] 're out there .	they
[MASK] see .	I
If he did n't take his lunch every day , would [MASK] feed him every day ?	she
Yeah , [MASK] does .	she
I mean – well , when they 're in the field , [MASK] has to take his lunch .	he
[MASK] 's just part of the deal .	That
Otherwise [MASK] 'll starve .	he
No , otherwise [MASK] does n't get lunch .	he
Well [MASK] know , that 's what starving is .	I
Actually , [MASK] think that if she found out he come and did n't have a lunch , she 'd fix him one .	I
Cause [MASK] 's what she does with other people .	that
But all winter [MASK] fixes him lunch .	she
Oh , cause [MASK] 're always close enough to –	they
Actually [MASK] 's more of a dinner , because it 's –	it
[MASK] will go get you another one .	I
N- [MASK] 's alright .	that
[MASK] just remembered .	She
No , [MASK] 's okay .	it
Soon as I sat it down – sat it down [MASK] thought , no lemon .	I
[MASK] knew it .	I
But [MASK] tastes so good with lemon in it .	it
[MASK] do n't even like ice tea .	I
Do [MASK] like hot tea ?	you
Yeah , [MASK] love hot tea .	I
But the [MASK] has n't blasted cold enough for me yet .	winter
Do [MASK] put lemon in your hot tea ?	you
[MASK] 'm going to today , cause I have a sore throat .	I
Well [MASK] answered –	I
[MASK] assumed it was me .	I
[MASK] was talking to Beth , because she had the lemon .	I
[MASK] get it .	I
Which [MASK] do n't have .	you
[MASK] get it , yeah .	I
Oh [MASK] know .	I
[MASK] do n't put lemon in my hot tea ,	I
[MASK] ever do ?	You
[MASK] only do when I have a sore throat .	I
[MASK] usually d- have , yeah , that 's good .	I
[MASK] , or lemon and honey is good .	Lemon
Now [MASK] wo n't be able to touch Jonathan .	you
Because [MASK] 're drinking lemon and honey ?	you
[MASK] 's got a sore throat .	She
No , because [MASK] have a cold .	I
[MASK] Jean sat there –	Martha
[MASK] helped a lot , did n't it .	That
Well , [MASK] was –	Carolyn
[MASK] do n't get it .	I
[MASK] loved the little bit about the potty training .	I
[MASK] always says that .	She
[MASK] told me the story of how uh , she trained all her kids by nine months .	She
[MASK] 'd –	I
Now [MASK] 's gotten back to eight , hunh ?	it
Oh [MASK] was at eight .	Barb
Yeah , the [MASK] were n't but –	boys
They only – [MASK] did n't make it till nine .	They
[MASK] know boys are slow ?	You
Yeah [MASK] know .	I
That said that , [MASK] 's not potty training , that 's mother training .	that
What did [MASK] say ?	he
[MASK] 're an idiot .	You
[MASK] 's trying .	She
[MASK] 's Mister Spock , and Cap-	It
[MASK] know .	I
That everyone – [MASK] was –	That
[MASK] was in the hospital three times .	She
And so , how did [MASK] react ?	Carolyn
[MASK] said thanks a lot , you know , because she was so worried about Jonathan .	She
Oh sh- like oh , [MASK] 's gon na go back again in other words .	he
[MASK] said but –	I
And then [MASK] told her that , she did n't outgrow it until she was five or something ?	she
[MASK] did n't have what ?	She
[MASK] are all going " Barb did n't outgrow it ? " .	We
[MASK] was five or something ?	She
So [MASK] was really happy .	Carolyn
Like " oh [MASK] is great news " .	this
So then [MASK] said , " but look at Barb , she 's healthy now " , and Carolyn looked at her , and sort of looked away , and I thought , oh boy .	I
[MASK] 's teething .	He
[MASK] should have heard him , the night we took him to the emergency room .	You
[MASK] sounded worse .	He
[MASK] 's scary .	That
[MASK] 'd have been like Michael .	I
Yeah , he – [MASK] was um –	he
[MASK] 'd be like Mom , uh , what should we do with this child .	I
Well his [MASK] was a hundred and four point five .	temperature
[MASK] is so high .	That
[MASK] 's lucky that he did n't –	He
How long was [MASK] there ?	he
How long , do [MASK] know ?	you
[MASK] do n't know .	I
That 's dangerou- – [MASK] mean s- –	I
Cause [MASK] could have , brain damage .	he
The doctor said – the [MASK] said that th- um , his pediatrician , cause I asked him about it , and he said that they do n't hospitalize until they go up to like a hundred and seven .	doctor
And that 's where [MASK] 's fatal .	it
And [MASK] was like , well , you know –	I
[MASK] does n't matter or ?	That
[MASK] said actually fevers are –	He
How did [MASK] explain it ?	he
[MASK] said something like , feathers – fevers are like , um , good for babies like , when they 're i- b- getting sick , because they help the immune system fight harder .	He
[MASK] do n't know .	I
Well that 's what the – I mean [MASK] 's what –	that
Is n't [MASK] part of it ?	that
No I 'm pretty – [MASK] 'm pretty sure , I 'm pretty sure that 's part of it , but uh it 's just that you have to watch out , cause then , if it gets too hot it 's bad for the brain .	I
[MASK] 's like a car , it overheats .	It
Maybe , I do n't – I – [MASK] 'm not sure .	I
Are [MASK] gon na stall out Jito ?	you
[MASK] 's all the babinos ?	Who
[MASK] know the one in the lower right .	I
This [MASK] is mine .	one
[MASK] recognize him alr- –	I
[MASK] 's the one that 's ten days older than –	That
That 's Michael 's – [MASK] are Michael 's nephews –	those
[MASK] 's Jose –	That
And then [MASK] 's the one in the middle .	Gino
[MASK] is in the middle .	Gino
[MASK] 's his sister .	That
Aw [MASK] 's a bit older .	he
Yeah [MASK] 's three .	he
[MASK] does n't look that –	He
He 's o- [MASK] 's three .	he
Is [MASK] talking any more ?	he
Is [MASK] talking good now ?	he
You ca n't understan- – he – [MASK] can but , then you ca n't , sometimes , some of the things he says .	you
Does [MASK] talk big long things but you just ca n't understand em ?	he
No , [MASK] 's okay then .	he
[MASK] 's a gestalt child .	He
[MASK] 's just two different ways .	It
Like , kids can either like , [MASK] 'll say one word , but they 'll say it really , like pretty clear , and that the way they 're th- they 'll have like twenty words or whatever , and they 'll just ask for one thing .	they
Are [MASK] okay ?	you
Cause [MASK] tickled his feet .	I
[MASK] 's all my fault .	It
It 's [MASK] drinks too fast .	he
[MASK] just went down the wrong pipe .	It
[MASK] need to burp ?	You
[MASK] was n't that bad .	It
So [MASK] 's just a d- like a different style .	it
[MASK] sorry .	I
Which way [MASK] gon na do ?	you
Is he a righ- are [MASK] a righty ?	you
[MASK] 're a righty .	You
[MASK] 's funny cause , h- he 'll be like , he 'll get up in the morning , he 'll sit in front of the TV with his bottle in one hand , just watching TV , like half asleep , you know , he 's a –	It
[MASK] 'm like , go- –	I
While ago [MASK] was here –	he
If [MASK] lay –	you
And [MASK] was watching the football game –	he
[MASK] 's low , Issac –	That
[MASK] was watching the football game –	He
[MASK] 's low .	That
[MASK] 's true .	It
[MASK] 're dwibbling .	you
You seen [MASK] was gross .	it
Michael , Michael 's [MASK] was all wet , from right here , from him just drooling .	shirt
[MASK] was –	It
Probably [MASK] was opening –	he
And [MASK] took him to the –	we
And then [MASK] could n't even breathe , he had , um , they had this thing , it was this big old long old tube .	he
And [MASK] was funny , like , we could –	it
[MASK] put a mist –	They
Child , [MASK] 're having problems .	you
You know , [MASK] remember , m – back in the psychedelic days , there was this poster of the scientist .	I
[MASK] 've always been on a , kind of a crusade , for scientific uh , responsibility .	I
And the way it 's marketed , and the way we 're d- — [MASK] develop needs for it .	we
And [MASK] remember this pf- cartoon I saw w- , of , of , it was called The Scientist .	I
And [MASK] had this , this wonderful stone statue , about twenty stories tall , of a naked man , and a naked woman , intertwined with each other , hugging each other , full frontal , and their arms wrapped around each other , and then they s- — they – they looked like they were so intertwined , and they spiraled down and , and they 're a s- — they 're a statue .	it
And they 're and the whole [MASK] of the statue is crumbling .	base
And [MASK] 's just like rubble , f- like from , just below the knees , down , was just kind of rubble .	it
But the [MASK] of it was all real clear , a few ottle- — some of it was chipped off , you know , it was old but , and d- — and down at the bottom , of this , this rubble , was this little man who was a scientist .	rest
And [MASK] had this big magnifying glass .	he
And [MASK] was looking at the rubble .	he
And , and , to me that , [MASK] always symbolized , kind of rather clearly , the limitations of the scientific method .	that
Whi- — if [MASK] does n't take into account the to- — the the the whole human experience , and , including , the unbelievable parts of it .	it
[MASK] mean the theories .	You
You know they — [MASK] 've got to take ac- into account , uh , the East , with all its , with all its fantastic discoveries .	they
But , you ca n't — but [MASK] ca n't look at the stars with a microscope .	you
And [MASK] is a microscope .	science
Each p- [MASK] has their , their field of um , expertise , and if they 're gon na go , if they 're gon na stretch out far enough into the — the unknown where they can find something new , they have to do it in a straight line .	scientist
[MASK] ca n't do it in all directions at once .	They
[MASK] 's true .	That
Because then [MASK] run into things that we already know .	you
So the [MASK] is communication between s- —	problem
But [MASK] 're doing it , they 're doing it with mathematics .	they
[MASK] mean .	I
But the comm- , [MASK] is , communication between the branches of science .	problem
[MASK] think .	I
[MASK] 's true .	That
Cause , [MASK] 's gon na be able to hold , all that knowledge , and make the connections ?	who
Those [MASK] can tell you .	people
But those [MASK] ca n't tell you the details .	people
[MASK] know the whole structure , but see .	They
[MASK] 's like both sides .	It
[MASK] have to have somebody looking at the details .	You
[MASK] got to have a leader .	Ya
And [MASK] got to have , a bunch of workers .	you
[MASK] know ?	You
And [MASK] got ta have somebody .	you
[MASK] d- is n't necessarily inclined to deal with the details that much , who 's guiding , those who are willing to sit there .	Who
[MASK] guess that 's the problem .	I
[MASK] do n't have a guider .	We
[MASK] 's right .	That
And — and uh , you know , I think , [MASK] think that , one of the reasons that there 's been no focus is because , oh , everybody accepted the scientific method as the best tool that we have , and was kinda letting the scientific method be the — be the leader .	I
You know , I mean , [MASK] was like , really off into wonderful abstract notions , that were all based in a peaceful world .	he
[MASK] know ?	You
[MASK] could n't exist unless he was secure that we had a peaceful world or that that peace was part of it .	That
And , so [MASK] of today 's technology is soulless and has nothing to do with peace .	much
[MASK] has to do with , just generally , chewing up , you know , consumerism basically and — .	It
Okay , so a [MASK] would be about that much with the x - rays , and then —	recheck
Does [MASK] sound right ?	that
[MASK] think if we — she woke up , we could w- send her home tonight .	I
[MASK] would n't see why we could n't send her home tonight , would you ?	I
Oh well , [MASK] 're gon na be Biotaling her and oh —	we
Sh- if she — [MASK] probably wo n't though .	she
[MASK] was thinking , I 'm still thinking —	I
And [MASK] wo n't have any an- antibiotics , cause there 's no break .	she
[MASK] is this ?	What
But , [MASK] 're opposite .	they
[MASK] 're still opposite .	They
Yeah , [MASK] looks alright .	that
Do n't [MASK] think we should charge them an extra eighteen ?	you
[MASK] does it .	Trent
[MASK] felt horrible doing that on that eye dog that he had in here last week , under whatever night it was .	I
Cause [MASK] had down twenty - five plus eighteen , and what can you do , when he 's already got it down ?	he
Well , well , all we did — [MASK] ca n't do that , cause all we did was , I was in here and put a bandage on .	I
Um , did [MASK] get hold of Dan then ?	you
[MASK] need one of these and one of these , one of those , and one of those , and two of those .	We
Well , [MASK] 'll call him probably late this afternoon , to make sure he 's alright .	I
No , [MASK] was just trying to figure out what we spent already .	I
But [MASK] 's better than pins , and surgery .	that
Right , [MASK] would be another two hundred or —	which
Yeah , [MASK] 's more for a surgery .	it
And that one really , you know , [MASK] do n't think it would benefit from pins .	I
Because [MASK] 'd have to undo it .	we
I mean we 'd have to , well , [MASK] 'd have to go —	we
We could — [MASK] could try it closed .	we
But , still , [MASK] 's more expensive .	it
[MASK] think it 'll do fine with a cast , especially since it 's a spiral fracture .	I
[MASK] 'll be kind of a pain getting the — well , maybe not , getting the cast over the stifle ?	It
Okay , [MASK] 'll give him a call .	I
[MASK] do n't know if he 's in the barn , from home .	I
Mm , yeah and [MASK] 're little little kids too .	they
[MASK] 're like ' I 'm three . '	They
[MASK] 's Marcia .	It
Um , [MASK] got x - rays done already , and , I was gon na let you know what , what was going on .	we
Should [MASK] talk to Richard or are you okay ?	I
Um , so [MASK] think that she would , she would do fine with a cast .	I
Um , and , [MASK] pretty much got an estimate so far , with the , coming in yesterday , and the x - rays and everything , the bill was about fifty - four .	I
[MASK] 's gon na be about a hundred and fifty - three , total .	It
And , the only , then it would be , the only extra would be , in about six to eight weeks , [MASK] 'd have her come in again , we would tranquilize her , and take the X - rays , and see if it 's healed , enough to take off .	we
And [MASK] 's generally about thirty - four to forty , somewhere in there .	that
You know , a pin , you know , if we did a pin , it 's probably , [MASK] would probably be even a hundred more but , so it 's it 's that 's about the — at this point the , the least expensive alternative that probably will work for her .	it
Um , so , if [MASK] want to let him know and then have him call me back , if you , if you wan na go ahead and do it .	you
[MASK] wan na put this kitty castration down ?	You
And if she — you know , if we did it , [MASK] could probably go home tomorrow .	she
Am [MASK] doing that right so far ?	I
[MASK] think .	I
[MASK] do n't think I am .	I
And [MASK] 'd have to have that plus or minus .	you
[MASK] do n't know what I did to get that .	I
Where did [MASK] get that square root of — um , x squared ?	I
Because [MASK] brought this over here .	you
[MASK] brought three over here , divided by three , and then you have x squared , so if you want to find x , you have the square root of x squared .	You
[MASK] guess all I ca n't figure out is , what the square root of negative two thir – thi – two thirds is .	I
Would [MASK] be , i square root two thirds ?	that
The whole [MASK] would be over three .	thing
No [MASK] could n't be .	it
But then [MASK] got the other one Nathan .	you
[MASK] snoozing on the floor ?	She
Not anymore , [MASK] woke her up .	you
[MASK] 's doing the Karate Kid , Nathan .	She
[MASK] 's like , ' leave me alone . Do I deserve this ? '	She
I mean how would [MASK] like it , when you 're laying in bed , somebody just grabbed your arm , started swinging it around ?	you
[MASK] 'd probably just slap em .	I
[MASK] squared equals one over the square root of that , the square root of that , x equals the square root of one .	X
[MASK] 's not even looking at me .	She
[MASK] 's just looking , like —	She
[MASK] know .	I
[MASK] 's what I 'm talking about .	That
So , would that [MASK] be , square root of one half ?	one
[MASK] would ?	It
But do y' [MASK] have to do that , um , you have to like , have it where you do that , there 's no , um .	all
[MASK] mean no fraction under the —	I
So then [MASK] just multiply , the whole thing by the square root of two , and you get the square root of two over two .	you
For — [MASK] 'm talking about for this one .	I
[MASK] have the square root of one .	You
Since you have the square root of two on the bottom , to make that a square , [MASK] have to multiply by the square root of two .	you
And then [MASK] get two , and you multiply the top by the square root of two , and you get , square root of two .	you
[MASK] wan na rewind it and hear that back again .	I
Cause [MASK] sure did n't catch it the first time .	I
[MASK] got the two , and you take the square root of two , and you get the negative two , which you take the square , and it comes to two .	You
[MASK] 'm sorry .	I
[MASK] is what we came out with .	This
And then [MASK] multiply that by the square root of two , over the square root of two .	you
Uh , is [MASK] what all those square root of twos are ?	that
That 's what I was try — [MASK] 's what I was trying to say .	That
Okay , [MASK] was wondering where all that , square root two , square root two .	I
[MASK] 's what it was .	That
Then right here [MASK] 'd get , square root of two over two .	you
But , you have i — [MASK] have i square root of three , over square root of three .	you
[MASK] mean z — i square root of two over three — square root of three .	I
[MASK] ca n't even say it right .	I
Over , do [MASK] have another i down here , or just the one i ?	I
Is [MASK] right ?	that
[MASK] doubt it .	I
[MASK] really do .	I
[MASK] 'm not kidding .	I
You ca n't — [MASK] ca n't multiply square roots like that , can you ?	You
Square [MASK] of two , times square root of three , is square root of six , is it ?	root
Well , then [MASK] 's fine .	that
Then [MASK] is right .	that
Is n't that c- — [MASK] can do that .	you
Cause [MASK] 's the same way you 're multiplying there , square root of nine , that — and square root of nine equals three .	that
[MASK] have it .	You
I mean [MASK] have it .	I
The next [MASK] , is , five x , times x minus one .	one
Is [MASK] it ?	that
And [MASK] 's easy , you can do that .	that
Oh [MASK] is easy .	this
Cause if [MASK] 's not .	it
[MASK] does ?	It
And [MASK] can always put those back up into the top and , and see if they check .	I
Five , [MASK] got zero equals zero .	I
Tha- – [MASK] 's right .	that
And [MASK] 's one ?	that
[MASK] was thirty - eight and still believed in Santa Claus .	Betty
But sometimes [MASK] could be such an asshole .	he
[MASK] leaned against the kitchen counter , picking dried glaze from the wrinkles in the back of her hand .	She
From the wireless headset that dangled from her neck , her old marine [MASK] called to her with joyous profanity and the bass of digital gunfire .	buddies
The [MASK] was upstairs .	Xbox
Her [MASK] were in San Diego and Cleveland .	buddies
Satellite [MASK] in Santa ’s Village was just another Christmas miracle , like faster - than - light travel and stuffing oneself through gas fireplaces with neither explosions nor lawsuits nipping at your heels .	coverage
[MASK] was six o’clock .	It
[MASK] had said he needed to leave at eight .	Santa
So [MASK] had made Christmas Eve dinner while listening to — instead of participating in — the big special ops campaign game online .	Betty
[MASK] ’d garlic - salted the yams to the tune of Gomez unloading his Glock into a drug dealer .	She
[MASK] ’d painted the ham with maple glaze while Williams punctuated Patty Smyth ’s “ Goodbye to You ” with bursts from his assault rifle .	She
“ Her [MASK] , ” as she called them , did n’t take a lot of eggnog in their rum .	boys
[MASK] had spent his day opening envelopes from North American children and falling asleep watching the Pittsburgh - Cleveland game in the media room .	Santa
Now [MASK] was in the kitchen , awake and on his way out the door , because suddenly spending fifteen minutes eating dinner with his wife had become too much of a burden on this most wonderful night of the year .	he
[MASK] stretched the neckhole halfway down to his happy trail .	It
His [MASK] were finding their way through the armholes of his robe .	hands
“ It ’s just that there are more children in the world now , ” [MASK] said .	he
“ And [MASK] ’s not getting any younger , ho ho ho . ”	Santa
“ Do n’t get much older either , ” [MASK] said .	Betty
Santa ’s first [MASK] had died centuries ago , but he always just dismissed the question of his own mortality .	wife
[MASK] never knew how naughty she should feel about wanting to strangle him sometimes .	Betty
“ [MASK] ’re seriously going to let me eat alone again on Christmas Eve ? ”	You
“ Do n’t think of it like that , doll , ” [MASK] said .	Santa
[MASK] slung his belt around his back , and gave it a quick tug .	He
His [MASK] shrunk from dangerously obese to barely jolly .	waist
A few crumpled [MASK] in American currency fell out of his pocket .	bills
[MASK] bent down to pick them up , mumbling about “ emergency money . ”	Santa
“ Ca n’t you get dressed in the bedroom like a normal person ? ” [MASK] asked .	Betty
Distorted [MASK] erupted from Betty ’s headset .	shouting
[MASK] imagined red and yellow mosaic bursts lighting up the sunless snowscape outside , as if there was an HDTV behind the blinds instead of their kitchen window .	She
[MASK] of her boys probably stepped on a landmine .	One
Williams , [MASK] guessed .	she
[MASK] thought she could hear Gomez laughing .	She
[MASK] picked up the pans in which she ’d made the potatoes and maple glaze .	She
[MASK] put them in the sink to soak .	She
The gingerbread batter [MASK] could wait a day , even though it would take longer to clean tomorrow .	bowl
For now , [MASK] appreciated its fight to cover the ham - stink that coated the room .	she
The jingle [MASK] chimed on Santa ’s cell .	bell
“ Nutcrackers , ” [MASK] said .	he
“ [MASK] ca n’t reach it , and it ’s probably Ginny .	Santa
Would [MASK] be a doll ? ”	you
“ Your [MASK] ’s calling , and you need me to answer it ?	secretary
[MASK] wiped her fingers on a hand - towel .	Betty
[MASK] lifted her headset ’s microphone to her mouth .	She
“ [MASK] out .	Moroz
“ Copy that , ” [MASK] said on the other end .	Gomez
[MASK] switched off her headset mic .	Betty
[MASK] unclipped the cell phone from the back of Santa ’s girdle , and pushed the button with the green arrow , serrated to look like a double - edged diving knife .	She
“ Hey Ginny , ” [MASK] said into the phone .	Betty
“ Oh hello , Mrs. Claus , ” [MASK] said .	Ginny
Has [MASK] Claus left yet ? ”	Mr.
“ On his way , ” [MASK] said .	Betty
“ [MASK] was just thinking of the children .	He
[MASK] ’s very thorough . ”	He
When Tyler was very young , his [MASK] was his favorite person in the world because , unlike his parents , who believed that children should always be told the truth as adults understood it , she would fill in the gaps in his knowledge — Santa Claus , the Easter Bunny , God .	grandmother
His [MASK] were always too busy and often a little too serious , but his grandmother had a sense of peace about her , a lightness that lifted his spirit .	parents
A few times , when Tyler ’s parents were away , [MASK] took him with her to church .	she
[MASK] remembered liking the singing and the colorful windows , and how safe he felt there , in that large , empty space , sitting on a hard bench next to her warmth .	He
When she died , [MASK] overwhelmed Tyler .	grief
But like most adults , when he grew older [MASK] could only recall the intensity of that love in childhood in an abstract way .	he
[MASK] made the common error of identifying maturity with worth , and assumed that the love he had for her as a young child must have been lacking in strength and depth .	He
[MASK] was five or so , and they were playing some board game at the kitchen table .	He
As he swung his legs in his excitement , [MASK] kicked her repeatedly in the shins .	he
[MASK] asked him to stop , and he refused , giggling .	She
When she finally frowned at him and threatened to stop playing if he did n’t stop [MASK] told her to go to Hell .	he
In Tyler ’s mind [MASK] could see her face grow taut , lose color , and then , for the only time he could remember , she began to cry .	he
[MASK] also remembered his own utter confusion .	He
His [MASK] did not have much use for religion and so for him Hell was a word without much mystery or power .	parents
At that time [MASK] knew only vaguely that Hell was a place you did not want to go , like the dark basement or the even darker attic .	he
[MASK] remembered feeling resentful that she was crying and he did not even understand why .	He
[MASK] felt the guilt of this memory even in his teenage years .	Tyler
For him [MASK] summed up all his insecurities and fears about his own cruelty , ignorance , and the possibility that he was , in reality , not a good person .	it
The [MASK] that he had caused someone who loved him such pain with so little effort and understanding troubled him deeply .	fact
One day [MASK] looked through an old family photo album , and in it was a picture of the kitchen in the house they used to live in .	Tyler
Now [MASK] remembered that they always ate in the dining room , and when they did play board games , it was always on the coffee table in the living room .	he
The [MASK] that had caused him such pain over the years could not possibly have occurred .	memory
Somehow , [MASK] must have manufactured the whole scene in his imagination .	he
The [MASK] of his grandmother had probably caused in him feelings of abandonment and guilt .	death
In his confusion [MASK] had taken elements from storybooks and imagined out of nothing this memory to punish himself .	he
[MASK] was the sort of fantasy that could have occurred to any young child who lost an important relative .	This
With that realization , the [MASK] of his grandmother crying faded in his memory and became less and less believable .	image
[MASK] thought he was very lucky to have discovered the single error in his false memory , which enabled him to reason his way into distinguishing between reality and fantasy .	Tyler
[MASK] felt that it was a coming - of - age moment .	He
Nonetheless , [MASK] admitted to himself that he was a little sad also at the discovery .	he
For however imaginary that memory was , [MASK] was also a part of his love for his grandmother .	it
When that memory lost its compelling aura of truth , it was like another [MASK] of her died with it .	part
[MASK] had no name for the emptiness that remained .	He
[MASK] ’s just watching the weird retarded girl except this one chubby guy who ’s trying to get her to put down the lights but who ’s afraid to touch her .	Everyone
“ Not supposed to touch those , ” [MASK] says .	he
Is your [MASK] here ? ”	mom
“ Sorry ! ” [MASK] say .	I
The chubby [MASK] frowns at me .	guy
“ Cara , ” [MASK] say .	I
[MASK] looks at me , looks at the lights .	Cara
[MASK] gently try to take them .	I
“ No ! ” [MASK] wails .	she
“ [MASK] ’m sorry , ” I say , “ I ’m her brother .	I
[MASK] wails , but lets me disentangle her hands .	She
“ I ’m sorry , ” [MASK] say again , the concerned big brother .	I
“ [MASK] was just looking around and thought she was right with me , you know ?	I
Our [MASK] ’s down at Dillard ’s . ”	mom
Chubby [MASK] kind of hovers until I get the lights away from Cara and as soon as I put them on the shelf he grabs them and starts straightening them out and draping them back over the display .	guy
[MASK] herd Cara towards the front of the store , mouthing sorry at the front cashier .	I
[MASK] ’s kind of pretty .	She
[MASK] smiles at me .	She
Back out in the mall , [MASK] is wailing , which could start an asthma attack , so to distract her I say , “ You want a cookie ? ”	Cara
[MASK] has Cara on a diet , so of course she wants a cookie .	Mom
[MASK] perks up the way Shelby , our Shetland Sheepdog does , when you say ‘ treat . ’	She
[MASK] take her to the food court and buy her an M&M cookie and buy myself a Mountain Dew and then while she ’s eating her cookie , I pull the deck of cards out of my pocket and unwrap it .	I
[MASK] ’ve got another fifteen minutes before we have to meet my mom .	We
The [MASK] who lasts the longest gets to draw an extra card .	one
[MASK] ca n’t wait to show Toph and Len .	I
[MASK] has chocolate smeared on her mouth , but she lets me wipe her face off .	Cara
“ You ready to go back to see Mom ? ” [MASK] say .	I
When we pass Spencer ’s again , [MASK] stops .	she
“ Uhhh , ” [MASK] says , pointing to the store .	she
[MASK] always tries to get her to say what she wants , but I know what she wants and I do n’t want to fight with her .	Mom
“ No , ” [MASK] say .	I
Cara ’s [MASK] crumples up and she hunches her thick shoulders .	face
“ Uhhh , ” [MASK] says , mad .	she
“ It ’s okay , ” [MASK] say .	I
[MASK] swings at me .	She
[MASK] grab her hand and pull her behind me .	I
[MASK] tries to sit down , but I just keep on tugging and she follows me , gulping and wailing .	She
“ What did you do ? ” my [MASK] says when she sees us .	mom
My [MASK] had to buy stuff , like gym shorts for me and underwear for herself , so I told her that I ’d take Cara with me while she bought her stuff .	mom
[MASK] ’s holding a Dillard ’s bag .	She
“ She wanted to go in Spencer ’s , ” [MASK] say .	I
“ [MASK] went in but she kept grabbing stuff and I had to take her out and now she ’s upset . ”	We
“ Robert , ” my [MASK] says , irritated .	mom
[MASK] crouches down .	She
[MASK] trail out of the store , Cara holding Mom ’s hand and sniffling .	We
By the time we get to the car , though , [MASK] ’s wheezing .	Cara
[MASK] digs out Cara ’s inhaler and Cara dutifully takes a hit .	Mom
[MASK] tried it once and it was pretty dreadful .	I
[MASK] sits in her booster seat in the back of the car , wheezing all the way home , getting worse and worse , and by the time we pull in the driveway , she ’s got that white look around her mouth .	Cara
“ Robert , ” [MASK] says ,	Mom
“ [MASK] ’m going to have to take her to the Emergency Room . ”	I
“ Okay , ” [MASK] say and get out of the car .	I
“ You want to call your dad ? ” [MASK] asks .	Mom
“ [MASK] do n’t know how long we ’ll be . ”	I
[MASK] checks her watch .	Mom
[MASK] ’s three something now .	It
“ [MASK] may not be home in time for dinner . ”	We
[MASK] do n’t want to call my dad who is probably with Joyce , his girlfriend , anyway .	I
[MASK] is always trying to be likable and it gets on my nerves after a while — she tries way too hard .	Joyce
“ I can just make a sandwich , ” [MASK] say .	I
“ I want you to stay at home , then , ” [MASK] says .	she
“ [MASK] ’ve got my cell phone if you need to call . ”	I
“ Can Toph and Len come over ? ” [MASK] ask .	I
[MASK] sighs .	She
[MASK] opens the garage door so I can get in .	She
[MASK] stand there and watch her back down the driveway .	I
[MASK] turns back , watching where she ’s going , and she needs to get her hair done again because I can really see the gray roots .	She
[MASK] is watching me through the watery glass , her mouth a little open .	Cara
[MASK] wave good - bye .	I
[MASK] ’m glad they ’re gone .	I
The first [MASK] of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky .	drops
[MASK] disappeared immediately , drunk down into the mineral silence .	They
The [MASK] paused , and everything held its breath and waited .	garden
More [MASK] would come .	rain
[MASK] knew , beyond belief or necessity that the time had come .	Everyone
Heavy oily [MASK] bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground , gathering in stems and folds on the way .	drops
Yet still the [MASK] was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight .	sky
Still the [MASK] held its breath .	garden
[MASK] would not be long now .	It
A [MASK] of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots , shivering through shoots and tendrils , humus and stone .	spattering
Wispy vapour [MASK] marbled the blue surface above .	trails
[MASK] sat on the porch watching , no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall as drops turned to torrents and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar .	We
[MASK] erupted and overflowed along the edges of the lawn , cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds .	Pools
[MASK] rose up from the water - laden earth where they could no longer breath and wriggled and struggled fro air on the surface , writhing and swimming for a safe haven .	Earthworms
[MASK] burst over the barrels and cans standing under the eaves and gutters , flooding the pathways , carrying away all that was n’t fixed solid and licking at the stairs to the back porch before climbing each step and lapping against the planks we were sitting on , a wooden raft surrounded by angry water and martial beat drum , drum , drumming on the roof above .	Water
[MASK] slipped out feet over the sides and when we felt the fish , some as big as logs , some as small as leaves , nibble at our feet , we leant over to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface .	We
[MASK] lapped at the porch , washing away the boxes , and bowls , and the dog ’s basket .	Waves
The rocking [MASK] , the watering can , boxes of cuttings , and tied - up newspapers , all floated away as we slammed the kitchen door shut and retreated to the front room we gazed out at the river that the street had become .	chair
The [MASK] was pewter smeared with charcoal now , and pressed down hard on the rooftops , slowly dissolving everything below .	sky
When the water rippled into the hallway , [MASK] splashed our way to the staircase and then up as it nipped at our heels .	we
Outside the other [MASK] were rocks surrounded by sea with mermaids swimming all around , flapping their scaly tails and hauling themselves up , to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves .	houses
And as they swam [MASK] sang , their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain , and we could hear them singing , He is coming , He is coming .	they
And [MASK] combed their long hair in preparation .	they
[MASK] waved and called , and they laughed and played , tantalising , their seaweed locks just out of reach .	We
With a flick of the tail [MASK] were off , still singing , He is coming , He is coming , until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water .	they
A great whiskered [MASK] arose , then a belly , wet and sleek , long enough to wrap itself twice around the world .	head
“ Is it him ? ” [MASK] asked each other , nudging elbows and climbing onto the chairs .	we
[MASK] pulled off wet socks and shoes , letting them float away on the tide , before the great worm turned and the wake engulfed the creaking , cracking house .	We
[MASK] clambered up onto the roof , sliding on the tiles and clinging to chimney stacks , sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour .	We
The [MASK] was black , and the stormy sea all the deepest , darkest blues and greens and greys and flecked with white where the sea - horses galloped .	sky
The [MASK] broke making way for the gnarled head of a whale , spouting water high against the clouds before opening its whiskered maw and in a looming , booming voice called : He is coming , He is coming .	waters
The [MASK] washed away , so we scrambled onto the blue - black back encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky and held on tight as he rode the waves , dipping and blowing , dipping and blowing .	chimneys
The [MASK] and the rain tugged at our hair .	wind
[MASK] heard a fearsome creaking and cracking and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away , deeping down in the troughs and riding the crests with torn sails set against the wind .	We
[MASK] was a galleon with masts like a dead man ’s fingers , tarred timbers groaning and a mermaid sat on the bow as he ship dipped and passed .	It
He is coming , He is coming , [MASK] sang out .	she
And just as the wash hit us , prising us from the whale ’s speckled back and down into the sea , [MASK] threw down a knotted rope and we hung on for dear life .	someone
The singing [MASK] hauled us aboard chanting , He ’s a coming - ha ! He ’s a coming - ha !	sailors
And [MASK] fell onto the deck like fish bursting from a net .	we
The [MASK] stood above us dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings .	Captain
[MASK] had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city .	I
[MASK] had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie .	I
And after the war , [MASK] had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills .	I
[MASK] had one granddaughter who survived the war .	I
[MASK] saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio .	I
[MASK] never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous .	She
The [MASK] were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully .	young
So [MASK] was a city of grandmothers .	it
And [MASK] was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah - jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants .	it
[MASK] all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed .	We
“ We live in the modern era ! ” [MASK] cried .	she
“ [MASK] should be ashamed of yourself ! "	You
The [MASK] stood up from the table .	traveler
[MASK] was bony and rough - skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot .	She
“ Nonetheless , ” the [MASK] said , and she walked out .	traveler
[MASK] were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler .	They
The [MASK] of the bar was acrid with triumph .	air
Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — [MASK] was a delight .	that
But [MASK] followed the traveler , into the wet streets .	I
The [MASK] of fish oozed from the docks .	smell
[MASK] caught her at her door .	I
[MASK] invited me in for tea and massage .	She
Her [MASK] were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country .	limbs
[MASK] smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented .	She
In the morning , brilliant [MASK] scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone .	sunlight
[MASK] hurried home .	I
My [MASK] had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble .	house
My [MASK] was empty and cold .	house
[MASK] packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife .	I
[MASK] sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting .	I
When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , [MASK] refused to cry .	she
[MASK] would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she could n't — like tie knots , or catch a chicken .	She
A [MASK] hurtled through the scattered metal , the pilot desperate to find a way to stop himself from joining the ever growing population of this interstellar graveyard .	starfighter
[MASK] Chalmers was not alone in his frustration with the current situation , but he was doubtless one of the most panicked .	Jacques
[MASK] tried to steady himself as he began cycling once again through the available display options for his starfighter 's radar system .	He
His [MASK] continued to grow with each passing second , every change of the screen doing nothing to abate it .	anxiety
[MASK] stopped midway through the calibration and glanced out of his cockpit .	He
The [MASK] was the same as it had been a few moments ago and it brought him no comfort .	scene
[MASK] could n't count the number of capital ships that dominated the Enemy 's frontline .	He
In his years of service to the Imperial Naval Forces [MASK] had never seen anything like it , not even in archive war footage .	he
The enormous [MASK] of the battleships loomed like giants atop a hill , staring down upon a tiny village below .	forms
Knowing that he had already been flying straight for longer than was advisable , [MASK] altered his course to attempt to throw off any pursuers .	Chalmers
Not long before [MASK] had been standing on the flight deck of his deployment carrier , amongst the other pilots , his heart pumping in his ears , his hands sweating as he awaited the order to board his fighter .	he
[MASK] saw his friends run forward as their names were called out , scrambling into cockpits , pulling on helmets and performing last - minute safety checks .	Chalmers
As he watched his friends ' fighters hurtle down the catapult , his commanding [MASK] had addressed the last remaining pilots still standing on the flight deck .	officer
“ Right , listen up , ” [MASK] started .	he
“ This is where [MASK] must make our stand .	we
Tonight [MASK] fight the battle for Kethlan and for the Imperium ; the battle for our survival .	we
[MASK] of millions of lives are depending on our actions here .	Hundreds
Is [MASK] all that 's left ?	that
A few months ago [MASK] was billions .	it
This [MASK] had crept ever closer as cities , planets and then entire star systems had fallen to the Enemy ; to those damned Pandorans ; to the Senate 's mistake .	day
How many of his friends had [MASK] lost over these last few terrible months ?	he
Had [MASK] died fast or were they now suffering a fate far worse . . ?	they
A white [MASK] resided on their right arms and left breast , an all - encompassing full black helmet upon their heads , its smooth form negating all facial features .	emblem
[MASK] of the soldiers turned to face him , the ruby - like eyes seeming to pierce his very soul .	One
[MASK] felt his hand tighten on the flight helmet he held , swallowing hard .	He
“ Daniels ! Peterson ! Foster ! Brown ! Rye ... ” a [MASK] called out above the other sounds that filled the flight deck .	voice
[MASK] moved and Chalmers felt his stomach lurch .	Feet
[MASK] felt a sense of doom .	He
If the Empire could not stop the Enemy before , what hope did [MASK] have now ?	they
The Enemy 's [MASK] had grown exponentially and they had crushed everything in their path with harrowing little effort .	power
[MASK] was feeling forced to accept the truth : they were all that was left of the Imperial Naval Forces .	Chalmers
[MASK] was a battle that could not be won ; not now , not ever .	This
At the sound of his name , [MASK] felt himself move robotically , his mind screaming in protest against what his legs were doing .	Chalmers
[MASK] ran over to the waiting starfighter , threw on his helmet and begun ascending the ladder into the cockpit .	He
Zombie - like [MASK] sank down into the seat , watching as if from outside his body as his hands buckled him in , his fingers flip switches , press buttons , acknowledge questions and confirmations on the screens before him .	he
[MASK] hate the moon - I am afraid of it - for when it shines on certain scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideous .	I
[MASK] was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where I wandered ; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild and many - coloured dreams .	It
And as I walked by the shallow crystal stream [MASK] saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light , as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world .	I
Silent and sparkling , bright and baleful , those moon - cursed [MASK] hurried I knew not whither ; whilst from the embowered banks white lotos - blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate night - wind and dropped despairingly into the stream , swirling away horribly under the arched , carven bridge , and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm , dead faces .	waters
And as I ran along the shore , crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces , [MASK] saw that the garden had no end under that moon ; for where by day the walls were , there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths , flowers and shrubs , stone idols and pagodas , and bendings of the yellow - litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble .	I
And the [MASK] of the dead lotos - faces whispered sadly , and bade me follow , nor did I cease my steps till the stream became a river , and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea .	lips
Upon that sea the hateful [MASK] shone , and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes breeded .	moon
And as I saw therein the lotos - faces vanish , [MASK] longed for nets that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night .	I
But when that moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore , [MASK] saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered , and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed .	I
And knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come , [MASK] trembled and did not wish again to speak with the lotos - faces .	I
Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef , [MASK] would fain have questioned him , and asked him of those whom I had known when they were alive .	I
This [MASK] would have asked him had he not been so far away , but he was very far , and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef .	I
So [MASK] watched the tide go out under that sinking moon , and saw gleaming the spires , the towers , and the roofs of that dead , dripping city .	I
And as I watched , my [MASK] tried to close against the perfume - conquering stench of the world 's dead ; for truly , in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy sea - worms to gnaw and glut upon .	nostrils
Over these horrors the evil [MASK] now hung very low , but the puffy worms of the sea need no moon to feed by .	moon
And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath , [MASK] felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown , as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it .	I
Nor had my [MASK] trembled without cause , for when I raised my eyes I saw that the waters had ebbed very low , shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had seen before .	flesh
And when I saw that the reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below , [MASK] shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters , and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon .	I
And to escape this relentless thing [MASK] plunged gladly and unhesitantly into the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat sea - worms feast upon the world 's dead .	I
“ It does n’t hurt , Gram , ” [MASK] says .	Renata
My sixteen - year - old [MASK] pulls up her T - shirt sleeve to show her bare arm , the skin summer brown and the muscle swelling slightly into smooth biceps , flawless .	daughter
“ [MASK] had it done when I was little and see , you ca n’t even tell . ”	I
My [MASK] is sitting in the little examining room at the assisted living .	mother
[MASK] is white and hospital - like but there ’s no examining couch .	Everything
The [MASK] , a woman I do n’t know , is sitting in the other chair .	doctor
[MASK] ’s got Alzheimer ’s .	She
“ It ’s okay , Mom , ” [MASK] say .	I
[MASK] wants to understand , I can see that .	She
So [MASK] explain again .	I
“ [MASK] ’s an implant that will let them know where you are , and how you are .	It
[MASK] wo n’t hurt . ”	It
Her [MASK] water constantly , now .	eyes
In the time it takes me to explain [MASK] grasps and loses the words , grasps and loses phrases as they go past .	she
[MASK] looks at me and then at Renata , who is smiling , and finally submits uncomprehendingly .	She
[MASK] have worn her down .	We
The [MASK] bares my mother ’s arm , where the crepey flesh hangs loosely on the bones .	doctor
The [MASK] swabs her upper arm with antiseptic and says , “ I ’m going to give you something to numb it , okay ? ”	doctor
To me the [MASK] says in her normal voice , “ It ’s just a little lidocaine . ”	doctor
[MASK] do n’t like the doctor , but I do n’t know why .	I
[MASK] is no - nonsense .	She
[MASK] has professional hair , lightly streaked .	She
[MASK] is no reason to dislike her .	This
My [MASK] winces at the injection and is surprised again .	mother
[MASK] looks up at me , at Renata .	She
[MASK] are smiling , both of us .	We
“ Okay , ” my [MASK] says .	mother
[MASK] is okay ?	What
[MASK] have no idea .	I
[MASK] wait for a few minutes .	We
My [MASK] says , “ Is it time to go ? ”	mother
“ Not yet , ” [MASK] say .	I
“ [MASK] ’re going to give you an injection . ”	They
“ What ? ” my [MASK] says .	mother
“ [MASK] ’re going to implant a chip .	They
[MASK] will help them take care of you . ”	It
[MASK] try to say it every time as if it was the first time I said it .	I
[MASK] do n’t want to embarrass her .	I
Her [MASK] swings around , from Renata to me to the doctor and then back to Renata .	head
“ It ’s okay , Gram , ” [MASK] says .	Renata
“ Renata , ” my [MASK] says .	mother
The [MASK] has an injection gun and while my mother is focused on my daughter , she puts it firmly against my mother ’s arm and puts the chip in .	doctor
[MASK] ’s another low - grade moment of horror , but I think about that particular time with my mother because Renata was there and we were united , she and I .	It
So [MASK] ’s a good memory .	that
[MASK] come back to it a lot .	I
The last two nights [MASK] have dreamed of dogs in trouble .	I
[MASK] do n’t dream about Renata , although when the dreams wake me up , it ’s thinking about Renata that keeps me awake .	I
The first night [MASK] dreamed of seeing a stray dog and not stopping to pick it up although it was wandering in an empty parking lot near a busy road .	I
[MASK] was the first night Renata did n’t come home and it does n’t take Freud to figure out what that meant .	That
Seventeen - year - olds sleep on friends ’ couches , [MASK] know .	I
Or [MASK] might be sleeping in her car .	Renata
The second night [MASK] dreamed that I was on a desert island and Sonia , our golden retriever , was with me .	I
[MASK] laid her down on some sticks .	I
[MASK] trusts me , she ’s more my dog than anyone ’s , and she did n’t like it but for me she lay there .	She
In my dream [MASK] told her , “ Stay , Sonia . Stay . ”	I
[MASK] stayed because I held her there by looking at her , the way you can sometimes will a dog into submission .	She
[MASK] stayed while I lit the fire .	She
And then the [MASK] of it all hit me and I said , “ Sonia , up ! ”	horror
And [MASK] woke up .	I
[MASK] was last night , the second night Renata did n’t come home .	That
[MASK] 's not real .	It
[MASK] 's just a dream . "	It
[MASK] did n't start out here .	It
Most [MASK] would say it started with the Fireflies , but they 'd be wrong .	people
[MASK] ended with all those things .	It
For me , [MASK] began with Robert Paglino .	it
At the age of eight , [MASK] was my best and only friend .	he
[MASK] were fellow outcasts , bound by complementary misfortune .	We
[MASK] was developmental .	Mine
[MASK] was genetic : an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness , acne , and ( as it later turned out ) a susceptibility to narcotics .	His
His [MASK] had never had him optimized .	parents
Those few TwenCen [MASK] who still believed in God also held that one should n't try to improve upon His handiwork .	relics
[MASK] arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half - dozen kids , those lucky few in front punching him in the head , the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn .	I
[MASK] watched him raise his arms , almost hesitantly , to ward off the worst of the blows .	I
[MASK] could see into his head better than I could see into my own ; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back , that they 'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more .	I
Even then , at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone , [MASK] was becoming a superlative observer .	I
But [MASK] did n't know what to do .	I
[MASK] had n't seen much of Pag lately .	I
[MASK] was pretty sure he 'd been avoiding me .	I
Still , when your best friend 's in trouble [MASK] help out , right ?	you
Even if the odds are impossible — and how many eight - year - olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy ? — at least [MASK] call for backup .	you
[MASK] just stood there .	I
[MASK] did n't even especially want to help him .	I
[MASK] did n't make sense .	That
Even if he had n't been my best friend , [MASK] should at least have empathized .	I
[MASK] 'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence ; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance , scared them even as they incapacitated me .	I
[MASK] was no stranger to the taunts and insults , or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B .	I
[MASK] knew how that felt .	I
Or [MASK] had , once .	I
[MASK] was still working up the algorithms to get it back , still learning by observation .	I
Pack [MASK] always tear apart the weaklings in their midst .	animals
Every [MASK] knows that much instinctively .	child
Maybe [MASK] should just let that process unfold , maybe I should n't try to mess with nature .	I
Then again , Pag 's [MASK] had n't messed with nature , and look what it got them : a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs .	parents
In the end , [MASK] worked where empathy failed .	propaganda
Back then [MASK] did n't so much think as observe , did n't deduce so much as remember — and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog .	I
So [MASK] picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag 's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game .	I
A [MASK] , turning to face the new threat , took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek .	third
[MASK] remember wondering why I did n't take any satisfaction from that sound , why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about .	I
The [MASK] of them ran at the sight of blood .	rest
[MASK] of the braver promised me I was dead , shouted " Fucking zombie ! " over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner .	One
[MASK] of the enemy twitched at my feet .	Two
[MASK] kicked one in the head until it stopped moving , turned to the other .	I
[MASK] grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking , without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach .	Something
" Oh , " [MASK] said .	I
One [MASK] lay motionless .	thing
The [MASK] moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball .	other
" Oh shit , " [MASK] panted .	Pag
[MASK] coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt .	Blood
His [MASK] was turning blue and yellow .	cheek
[MASK] thought of something to say .	I
" [MASK] all right ? "	You
" Oh shit , you — I mean , [MASK] never ... "	you
[MASK] wiped his mouth .	He
[MASK] smeared the back of his hand .	Blood
" Oh man are [MASK] in trouble . "	we
" [MASK] started it . "	They
The moaning [MASK] was crawling away on all fours .	thing
[MASK] wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements .	I
[MASK] wondered if I should kill it before then .	I
" You 'd a never done that before , " [MASK] said .	Pag
Before the operation , [MASK] meant .	he
[MASK] actually did feel something then — faint , distant , but unmistakable .	I
[MASK] felt angry .	I
" [MASK] started — "	They
[MASK] backed away , eyes wide .	Pag
" What are [MASK] doing ?	you
[MASK] 'd raised my fists .	I
[MASK] did n't remember doing that .	I
[MASK] unclenched them .	I
[MASK] took a while .	It
[MASK] had to look at my hands very hard for a long , long time .	I
The [MASK] dropped to the ground , blood - slick and glistening .	rock
" [MASK] was trying to help . "	I
[MASK] did n't understand why he could n't see that .	I
" You 're , you 're not the same , " [MASK] said from a safe distance .	Pag
" [MASK] 're not even Siri any more . "	You
" [MASK] am too .	I
" [MASK] cut out your brain ! "	They
" [MASK] know for the epilepsy !	I
[MASK] think I do n't know ?	You
But [MASK] were in that half — or , like , part of you was ... "	you
[MASK] struggled with the words , with the concept behind them .	He
" And now [MASK] 're different .	you
It 's like , your [MASK] and dad murdered you — "	mom
" My [MASK] and dad , " I said , suddenly quiet , " saved my life .	mom
[MASK] would have died . "	I
" [MASK] think Siri died , they scooped him out and threw him away and you 're some whole other kid that just , just grew back out of what was left .	I
[MASK] 're not the same .	You
[MASK] 're not the same . "	You
[MASK] was Sunday in snowy Manhattan .	It
[MASK] was in the tub , and I was doing the Times crossword , listening to the clang of the radiators and the swish of the taxis on the slush outside , when my coffee - scented reverie was broken by a loud squawk from the bathroom , and a splash , and a flesh - upon - cold - tile sort of thump .	Jenna
[MASK] threw down my pen and dashed down the hall .	I
[MASK] was picking herself up off the floor of the bathroom .	Jenna
In the bathtub , a [MASK] of soap was gaily chasing a nylon scrubby thing around the surface of the water .	bar
“ Damned pixies ! ” [MASK] said , smacking the bathtub ’s drain lever .	Jenna
[MASK] am so tired of these things ! ”	I
A piteous [MASK] came from the scrubby thing as the water began to swirl down the drain .	squeak
A translucent little [MASK] poked out from behind a pot of organic - sugarcane exfoliating body polish , and looked at me with exaggerated puppy eyes and a trembling lower lip .	head
“ Sorry , kids , ” [MASK] said to the bathtub .	I
“ Do n’t humor them , dammit , ” [MASK] said , and stomped , still naked , still wet , toward the phone in the kitchen .	Jenna
[MASK] could n’t say I blamed her .	I
[MASK] got the brunt of the pixies ’ odd sense of humor much more than I did , because she ’s the one who likes to take baths .	She
Although [MASK] will say that a pixie hiding in the sink among the dirty soup bowls makes doing the dishes an adventure .	I
[MASK] ’s Jenna McMasters in 5C .	It
Ramon , the [MASK] are out of control .	pixies
[MASK] ’ve got to do something about —	You
yes , [MASK] know —	I
Ramon , the [MASK] is n’t for weeks and weeks .	equinox
Really , [MASK] need you to do something sooner ...	we
Well , [MASK] ’m just not ready to wait that long .	I
[MASK] may have to try something on our own , then .	We
[MASK] ’ve been a huge goddamn help . ”	You
[MASK] hung up the phone .	She
“ Man , he ’s useless , ” [MASK] said .	she
“ On the other hand , ” I said , “ [MASK] ’s the first super we ’ve had who keeps the boiler , the door buzzers , and the electrical system in perfect working order . ”	he
[MASK] took the robe I ’d brought from the bathroom and wrapped it around her shoulders .	I
“ Robert , this [MASK] of thing never happened in San Francisco . ”	sort
“ No , ” [MASK] said .	I
“ In San Francisco [MASK] got earthquakes , and there were wood sprites in Golden Gate Park .	we
“ [MASK] keep trying to tell myself that this is cool .	I
But then [MASK] come at me on a Sunday morning , when I have no work to do and I ’m trying to relax and I ’m naked , and I just lose it ... . ”	they
“ And you take it out on the super , ” [MASK] said .	I
“ And now I ’m gon na have a bruise on my butt , too , ” [MASK] said .	she
“ Well , [MASK] ’s karma for you .	that
[MASK] smiled .	Jenna
[MASK] was our previous Sunday morning adventure : most unpleasant , and marked by the death of a new French - press pot .	That
[MASK] realized that I , too , hated the pixies .	I
“ We need a plan , ” [MASK] said .	I
[MASK] Rook took Carroll home to meet her parents two months after she first slept with him .	Rachel
For a generous girl , a girl who took off her clothes with abandon , [MASK] was remarkably close - mouthed about some things .	she
In two months [MASK] had learned that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town ; that they sold strawberries in summer , and Christmas trees in the winter .	Carroll
[MASK] knew that they never left the farm ; instead , the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists .	He
Do you think your parents will like me ? " [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully as if he were preparing for an exam .	He
[MASK] had gotten his hair cut , trimmed his nails , washed his neck and behind his ears .	He
The [MASK] he had chosen , khaki pants and a blue button - down shirt -- no tie -- lay neatly folded on the bed .	outfit
[MASK] stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks , gazing at her as if she were a mirror .	He
" No , " [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] was the first time she had been to his apartment , and she stood square in the center of his bedroom , her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down , to touch something .	It
" My father will like you , " [MASK] said .	she
" But [MASK] likes everyone .	he
My [MASK] 's more particular --	mother
[MASK] thinks that you lack a serious nature . "	she
[MASK] put on his pants , admiring the crease .	Carroll
" So [MASK] 've talked to her about me . "	you
" But [MASK] have n't talked about her to me . "	you
" Are [MASK] ashamed of her ? "	you
[MASK] snorted .	Rachel
Then [MASK] sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home .	she
" You 're ashamed of me , " [MASK] guessed , and Rachel kissed him and smiled and did n't say anything .	he
[MASK] still lived on her parents ' farm , which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long .	Rachel
[MASK] suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll 's heart with admiration and lust .	It
[MASK] was nineteen , two years younger than Carroll ; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town , and then back again on her bike , four miles uphill to the farm .	She
[MASK] met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library , where he had a part - time job .	Carroll
[MASK] sat at the checkout desk , stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class ; he was almost asleep when someone said , " Excuse me . "	He
[MASK] looked up .	He
The [MASK] who stood before the tall desk was red - headed .	girl
[MASK] streaming in through a high window opposite her lit up the fine hairs on her arm , the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt .	Sunlight
The [MASK] turned her hair to fire and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her .	sunlight
" Can I help you ? " [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] placed a shredded rectangle on the desk , and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger .	She
[MASK] hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine .	Pages
" I need to pay for a damaged book , " [MASK] said .	she
" What happened ? Did your dog eat it ? " [MASK] said , making a joke .	he
" Yes , " [MASK] said , and smiled .	she
" What 's your name ? " [MASK] said .	Carroll
Already , [MASK] thought he might be in love .	he
Does n’t [MASK] make you just want to sneeze ?	it
[MASK] was leaning against the wall , watching the street go by .	Pete
[MASK] pulled the bike to a halt , the front wheel pointing in his direction .	I
“ [MASK] think I ’ve got a fairy stuck up my nose . ”	I
“ Hey ! Not bad that ! ” [MASK] said .	Pete
“ [MASK] did n’t see your lips move at all . ”	I
“ [MASK] ’s not a joke . ”	It
The [MASK] was getting worse .	itching
[MASK] pulled out a paper tissue .	I
“ [MASK] know I do n’t like it . ”	You
[MASK] make me want to sneeze ! ”	You
And [MASK] did .	I
[MASK] inspected the crumpled paper .	I
[MASK] looked at me with mild disgust as I eyed the handkerchief more closely .	Pete
“ You know that ’s pretty gross … ” [MASK] said .	he
“ Got any other brilliant remarks ? ” [MASK] said .	I
[MASK] held a finger up to my lips , and waved a hand to silence Pete ’s reply .	I
“ Are you still there ? ” [MASK] called .	I
[MASK] looked at me sort of sideways .	Pete
“ Look , the first [MASK] was OK , but — ”	time
“ [MASK] ’s not a joke .	It
[MASK] ’ve really got something stuck up there .	I
[MASK] was riding on me bike and I thought I ’d swallowed an insect or something .	I
And then [MASK] started insulting me . ”	it
“ [MASK] ’re having me on , right ? ”	You
If it ’s a trick , how do [MASK] do it then ? ”	I
[MASK] thought for a moment .	Pete
And [MASK] have to tell you where it is if you catch them ? ”	they
“ So [MASK] ’s the difference ?	what
“ We — ? ” [MASK] started .	I
[MASK] winked at me .	He
“ [MASK] ’s noggins here who wants to get rid of me … ”	It
Suddenly [MASK] felt a violent pain in my nose , my eyes watered .	I
“ Owwww ! ” [MASK] howled .	I
“ See what I mean ? ” the [MASK] shouted over my moans .	voice
“ Perhaps you can use it in exams … ” [MASK] said , scratching his head .	Pete
“ You know , [MASK] could tell us all the answers . ”	it
“ Ca n’t [MASK] whisper ? ”	it
“ Have [MASK] thought of that ? ”	you
“ Anyway , [MASK] do n’t want it in exams .	I
[MASK] just want it to go .	I
“ Ca n’t [MASK] just poke it out ? ”	you
“ Yes he has , ” the [MASK] said .	voice
“ And it was n’t pleasant [MASK] can tell you . ”	I
“ [MASK] see what it ’s like .	You
[MASK] ’s already making sarcastic remarks like that … ”	He
[MASK] do n’t know … A spider ? ”	I
“ No ! ” [MASK] both said at once .	we
“ Snap ! ” [MASK] said .	Pete
“ [MASK] both said the same thing at the same time , you ’ve got to make a — ” He hit his forehead with his palm .	You
“ [MASK] ’s it !	That
When you catch a fairy , [MASK] get three wishes .	you
Is [MASK] right ? ”	that
“ I wish you ’d get out of my nose , then ! ” [MASK] cried .	I
In a flash the [MASK] was out of my nose and gone .	fairy
And [MASK] ’m still waiting for my two other wishes .	I
Once it got started , [MASK] realised that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier ’s How to Ditch Your Fairy , although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all .	I
All in all , my [MASK] feels very light .	story
But [MASK] think I needed something a little less dark , and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks .	I
“ [MASK] have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling .	I
For an indefinite time [MASK] clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated , quite unheeding how I went , and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived .	I
One [MASK] records days , and another thousands of days , another millions of days , and another thousands of millions .	dial
Now , instead of reversing the levers , [MASK] had pulled them over so as to go forward with them , and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch — into futurity .	I
“ As I drove on , a peculiar [MASK] crept over the appearance of things .	change
The palpitating [MASK] grew darker ; then — though I was still travelling with prodigious velocity — the blinking succession of day and night , which was usually indicative of a slower pace , returned , and grew more and more marked .	greyness
[MASK] puzzled me very much at first .	This
The [MASK] of night and day grew slower and slower , and so did the passage of the sun across the sky , until they seemed to stretch through centuries .	alternations
At last a steady [MASK] brooded over the earth , a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky .	twilight
The [MASK] of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared ; for the sun had ceased to set — it simply rose and fell in the west , and grew ever broader and more red .	band
All [MASK] of the moon had vanished .	trace
The [MASK] of the stars , growing slower and slower , had given place to creeping points of light .	circling
At last , some time before I stopped , the [MASK] , red and very large , halted motionless upon the horizon , a vast dome glowing with a dull heat , and now and then suffering a momentary extinction .	sun
At one time [MASK] had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again , but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat .	it
[MASK] perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done .	I
The [MASK] had come to rest with one face to the sun , even as in our own time the moon faces the earth .	earth
Very cautiously , for I remembered my former headlong fall , [MASK] began to reverse my motion .	I
“ [MASK] stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine , looking round .	I
The [MASK] was no longer blue .	sky
North - eastward [MASK] was inky black , and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars .	it
Overhead [MASK] was a deep Indian red and starless , and south - eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where , cut by the horizon , lay the huge hull of the sun , red and motionless .	it
The [MASK] about me were of a harsh reddish colour , and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south - eastern face .	rocks
[MASK] was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves : plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight .	It
“ The [MASK] was standing on a sloping beach .	machine
The [MASK] stretched away to the south - west , to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky .	sea
Only a slight oily [MASK] rose and fell like a gentle breathing , and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living .	swell
The [MASK] reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering , and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now .	sensation
“ Far away up the desolate slope [MASK] heard a harsh scream , and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and , circling , disappear over some low hillocks beyond .	I
The [MASK] of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine .	sound
Looking round me again , [MASK] saw that , quite near , what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me .	I
Then [MASK] saw the thing was really a monstrous crab - like creature .	I
Can [MASK] imagine a crab as large as yonder table , with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly , its big claws swaying , its long antennæ , like carters ’ whips , waving and feeling , and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front ?	you
Its [MASK] was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses , and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there .	back
[MASK] could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved .	I
[MASK] stayed with me that night , lying next to me in my blankets and furs .	Veronique
She did n't sleep , [MASK] do n't think .	I
[MASK] was listening to her breath .	I
[MASK] felt as if I should help her sleep .	I
[MASK] lay there and tried to think if I should put my arm around her , but I did n't know .	I
Maybe [MASK] did n't want to be touched .	she
And [MASK] had been a stupid girl , anyway .	she
[MASK] lay tense in the dark .	She
" Are you going to be a teacher ? " [MASK] asked .	I
[MASK] laughed .	She
" If [MASK] get out of here . "	I
[MASK] waited for her to say more , but she did n't .	I
Maybe [MASK] meant if she made herself .	she
" You come here from Earth ? " [MASK] asked .	I
" My family came here from Earth , " [MASK] said .	she
" My father , he 's an anthropologist , " [MASK] said .	she
" Do [MASK] know anthropologist ? "	you
" No , " [MASK] said .	I
" [MASK] is a person who studies the way people live .	He
And [MASK] is a teacher . "	he
All the [MASK] I had ever met were teachers .	offworlders
[MASK] wondered who did all the work on Earth .	I
" Because Earth had lost touch with your world , the people here are very interesting to my father , " [MASK] said .	she
Her [MASK] was listless in the dark and she was even harder to understand when I could n't see her properly .	voice
[MASK] did n't understand so I did n't say anything .	I
[MASK] was sorry I 'd started her talking .	I
" History , do you know the word ' history ' ? " [MASK] asked .	she
Of course [MASK] knew the word " history . "	I
" I study history in school , " [MASK] said .	I
[MASK] and Kumar taught it .	Anneal
" Do [MASK] know the history of this world ? "	you
" Yes , " [MASK] said .	I
" [MASK] are a colony .	We
[MASK] from Earth come here to live .	People
[MASK] forget we are from Earth .	We
Then [MASK] finds us again . "	Earth
" Some people have stories about coming from the Earth , " [MASK] said .	Veronique
" My [MASK] is collecting those stories from different peoples .	father
[MASK] 'm a graduate student . "	I
The [MASK] did n't have any stories about coming from Earth .	clans
[MASK] said the first people came out of the sun .	We
[MASK] somehow seemed embarrassing .	This
[MASK] did n't understand what kind of student she was .	I
" Are you here for stories ? " [MASK] asked .	I
" No , " [MASK] said .	she
" [MASK] is old friends with your teacher , from back when they were both with the survey .	Ian
[MASK] just came to visit . "	We
[MASK] did n't understand what she 'd said except that they were visiting .	I
[MASK] were quiet after that .	We
[MASK] pretended to sleep .	I
[MASK] fell asleep thinking about how I wished that the Scathalos outrunners were gone .	I
[MASK] dreamed that I was at the offworlder 's home , where it was summer but no one was taking care of the stabros , and they were all glad , and so I was a hero - and I was startled awake by gunfire .	I
[MASK] wished my da would come home .	I
The Chemical [MASK] by Christian Rosencreutz is the way I ’ve decided to present the title of this book .	Wedding
[MASK] ’s not ; Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding .	It
The actual [MASK] is Johann Valentin Andreae , whose name did n’t appear on the book originally , thus ensuring the confusion .	author
[MASK] ’ll call it herein ( as everyone mostly does ) simply The Chemical Wedding .	I
[MASK] might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text that follows and only then return to this introduction .	You
[MASK] was just before Easter Sunday , 1 and I was sitting at my table .	It
[MASK] ’d said my prayers , talking a long time as usual with my Maker and thinking about some of the great mysteries the Father of Lights had revealed to me .	I
Now [MASK] was ready to make and to bake – only in my heart , actually – a small , perfect unleavened wafer to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb .	I
All of a sudden a terrible [MASK] blew up , so strong that I thought the hill my little house was built on would be blown apart – but I ’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before ( the Devil had often tried to harm me ) , so I took heart and went on meditating .	wind
Till [MASK] felt somebody touch me on the back .	I
[MASK] frightened me so that I did n’t dare turn .	This
[MASK] tried to stay as brave and calm as a human being could under the circumstances .	I
[MASK] felt my coat tugged at , and tugged again , and at last I looked around .	I
A [MASK] stood there , so bright and beautiful , in a sky - colored robe – a heavens covered with	woman
1 Christian ’s [MASK] begins just before Easter , like Dante ’s Divine Comedy .	story
The [MASK] sang so beautifully , the young deer skipped so happily , that it gladdened my old heart , and I could n't help singing too ...	birds
[MASK] was awake and lying in bed next morning , looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room , when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets , as if a procession were already underway .	I
My [MASK] jumped out of bed as if crazed , looking more dead than alive , and you can imagine how I felt when he cried , “ They 're already being presented to the king ! "	page
[MASK] could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones .	I
[MASK] soon came back and gave me the good news that I actually had n’t overslept ; all I ’d done was miss breakfast : they had n’t wanted to wake an old man who needed his rest .	He
But now [MASK] had to get ready to go with him to the lion fountain , where most of the others were gathered .	I
My [MASK] recovered , and as soon as I had got into my habit , I followed him to the garden I have already told about .	spirits
[MASK] found that the lion , in place of his sword , now held a rather large plaque .	I
Examining this , [MASK] could tell that it had been taken from those ancient monuments I ’d seen and put here for some special reason .	I
The [MASK] on it was fading away , so I should set it down here as it was then , and ask my readers to ponder it :	inscription
[MASK] Nick Bos tells Wikinews about ' self - medicating ' ants	Biologist
[MASK] Bos , of the University of Helsinki , studies " the amazing adaptations social insects have evolved in order to fight the extreme parasite pressure they experience " .	Nick
In a recently - accepted Evolution paper [MASK] and colleagues describe ants appearing to self - medicate .	Bos
" [MASK] have no doubt that as time goes on , there will be more and more cases documented "	I
The [MASK] used Formica fusca , an ant species that can form thousand - strong colonies .	team
This common black [MASK] eats other insects , and also aphid honeydew .	ant
[MASK] often nests in tree stumps or under rocks and foraging workers can sometimes be spotted climbing trees .	It
Infected [MASK] chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide , whereas healthy ants avoided it .	ants
Hydrogen [MASK] reduced infected ant fatalities by 15 % , and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was .	peroxide
In the wild , Formica [MASK] can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants .	fusca
The [MASK] reported self - medicating ants a first among insects .	Independent
[MASK] obtained his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen .	Bos
[MASK] began postdoctoral research at Helsinki in 2012 .	He

The [MASK] is a pun referencing ants , its primary topic , science , and " non-scientific " jargon - free communication .	name
[MASK] now discusses his work with Wikinews .	He
[MASK] first attracted you to researching ants ?	What
[MASK] and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies , from beetles , to butterflies and mantids , to ants .	Me
[MASK] had the ants in an observation nest , and I could just look at them for hours , watching them go about .	We
This was in my third year of Biology study [MASK] think .	I
After a while [MASK] needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies , and decided to write a couple of professors .	I
[MASK] ended up going to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d'Ettorre .	I
[MASK] liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I 've been working on social insects ever since .	I
[MASK] is a fun one .	This
[MASK] try to work on a very low budget , and like to build most of the experimental setups myself ( we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the ' Nickinator ' , ' i-Nick ' and the ' Nicktendo64 ' ) .	I
[MASK] collected wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree - trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland .	We
[MASK] then housed the ants in nests I made using Y - tong [ aerated concrete ] .	We
[MASK] 's very soft stone that you can easily carve .	It
[MASK] carved out little squares for the ants to live in ( covered with old CD covers to prevent them escaping ! ) .	We
[MASK] then drilled a tunnel to a pot ( the foraging arena ) , where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without .	We
[MASK] infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana .	We
After exposing the ants to the fungus , [MASK] took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day , and counted how many ants were present on each food - source .	we
[MASK] gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected .	This
For this [MASK] basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while .	we
Then for about two weeks [MASK] count every day how many ants died .	we
[MASK] gives us the data to do a so - called survival analysis .	This
[MASK] measured the ROS - concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer .	We
The detrimental [MASK] of ROS on spores was easy to measure .	effect
[MASK] mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores , plated them out on petri dishes with an agar - solution where fungus can grow on .	We
A day after , [MASK] counted how many spores were still alive .	we
How reliable do [MASK] consider your results to be ?	you
The [MASK] we got are very reliable .	results
[MASK] had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants , and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind .	We
[MASK] means the experimenter does n't know which ants belong to which treatment , so it 's impossible to influence the results with ' observer bias ' .	This
However , of course [MASK] is proof in just one species .	this
[MASK] interviews President of the International Brotherhood of Magicians	Wikinews

[MASK] spoke with William Evans , president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians , about the current state of magic and what its future looks like in the world of entertainment .	Wikinews
[MASK] am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier .	I
[MASK] remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I did n't even know what it did .	I
The [MASK] behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me , but instead sold me two books which I still own today - " Scarne on Card Tricks " and " Scarne on Magic Tricks " .	magician
[MASK] started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then .	That
My major [MASK] on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner .	influences
[MASK] is National Magic Month in the US .	October
Do [MASK] think magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today ?	you
Has the [MASK] helped or hurt magic ?	internet
[MASK] think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby , but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they are n't reading the books .	I
[MASK] have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before .	We
[MASK] can become a monkey ; it takes serious study to become a magician .	Anyone
Do [MASK] travel much in your current role ?	you
Yes , [MASK] am traveling quite a bit .	I
After I was inducted as International President in Phoenix in July , [MASK] have been to the Jeff McBride Experience in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , Magic Live in Las Vegas , The Midwest Magic Jubilee in St. Louis , the TAOM in Dallas , the British Ring Convention in Buxton , England and the Magic Circle in London .	I
[MASK] am going to Las Vegas and Los Angeles next month , Italy in November , back to Las Vegas in December , Mexico in January , Magi - Fest in February , the Winter Carnival of Magic in Tennessee in March , Eureka Springs Cavalcade of Magic in March , and the FFFF in April .	I

[MASK] Chomsky is a professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Linguistics and Philosophy .	Noam
[MASK] was one of the first opponents of the Vietnam War , and is a self - described Libertarian Socialist .	He
At age 80 [MASK] continues to write books ; his latest book , Hegemony or Survival , was a bestseller in non-fiction .	he
According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index [MASK] Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time .	Professor
On March 13 , [MASK] Chomsky sat down with Michael Dranove for an interview in his MIT office in Cambridge , Massachusetts .	Professor
[MASK] just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference , I know you ’re speaking at the counter-conference .	I
On the NATO conference , well I mean the obvious question is why should [MASK] exist ?	NATO
In fact [MASK] can ask questions about why it should ever have existed , but now why should it exist .	you
I mean the theory was , whether you believe it or not , that [MASK] would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression , that ’s the basic doctrine .	it
The agreement was that [MASK] agreed to a quite remarkable concession : he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance .	Gorbachev
Now [MASK] is remarkable in the light of history , the history of the past century , Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia , twice , and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance , centered in the most phenomenal military power in history , that ’s a real threat .	it
Nevertheless [MASK] agreed , but there was a quid pro quo , namely that NATO should not expand to the east , so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone .	he
And [MASK] Bush and James Baker , secretary of state , agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east .	George
[MASK] also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region , but the U.S would n’t consider that .	Gorbachev
Okay , so [MASK] was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed .	that
Well , [MASK] came into office what did he do ?	Clinton
Well [MASK] ’s a significant threat to the Soviet Union , to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union , it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity , not much but some .	that
So [MASK] rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike , NATO had never rescinded it , but they had and started some remilitarization .	they
With Bush , the aggressive [MASK] of the Bush administration , as predicted , induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity ; it ’s still going on right now .	militarism
When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe , Poland and Czechoslovakia , [MASK] was a real provocation to the Soviet Union .	it
And the claim was that [MASK] had to do with Iranian missiles , but forget about that .	it
And the head of NATO , Hoop Scheffer , [MASK] has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes , that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West .	he
Well [MASK] ’s kind of an unending war , so do we want NATO to exist , do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities , with no pretense of defense ?	that
Well [MASK] think that ’s a pretty good question ; I do n’t see why it should , I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable — if there happened to be one I ’d be opposed to that too .	I
So [MASK] think the first question is , what is this all about , why should we even be debating NATO , is there any reason why it should exist ?	I
[MASK] ’ve seen mass strikes all around the world , in countries that we would n’t expect it .	We
Do [MASK] think this is a revival of the Left in the West ?	you
Or do [MASK] think it ’s nothing ?	you
[MASK] ’s really hard to tell .	It
Sit down [MASK] which began at a significant level in the 1930’s were very threatening to management and ownership , because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management , and probably doing a better job .	strikes
So [MASK] ’s a frightening idea , and police were called in and so on .	that
Well [MASK] just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory , it ’s hard to know , I mean these things are just hard to predict , they may take off , and they may take on a broader scope , they may fizzle away or be diverted .	we
[MASK] interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail	Wikinews
[MASK] interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically - themed cocktail drink called Santorum .	Wikinews
Savage 's [MASK] voted to define santorum as ; " the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex . "	readers
The santorum [MASK] has inspired satirical forms of parody , including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner .	neologism
[MASK] commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail , " When he was winning in the polls , I thought , ' OK , I 'll do a Santorum ' . "	Stan
Regarding how long the beverage will be made available , [MASK] remarked to The Brooklyn Paper , " We 'll keep it around until he ’s irrelevant . I hope he ’s there the whole way " .	Stan
The main [MASK] of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety , Baileys Irish Cream , and Angostura bitters .	ingredients
[MASK] Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar .	Troy
After tasting the beverage , [MASK] observed , " My Santorum was sweet but balanced , with a subtle citrus pucker " .	Patterson
[ The santorum [MASK] is ] offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . — Rick Santorum	neologism
In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press , [MASK] Santorum compared legalizing same - sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality .	Rick
[MASK] of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator ’s last name , and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon .	Readers
The [MASK] became a prominent result in searches online , and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google , Bing , and Yahoo! .	term
[MASK] Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon ; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google 's response ;	Rick
[MASK] suspect that 's not true . "	I
[MASK] criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview , saying , " It 's offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . "	Santorum
Pacific Standard [MASK] , Jonathan M. Stan , displays the Santorum cocktail drink as a finished product at the bar . ( 2012 ) .	owner
[MASK] inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism ?	What
[MASK] the person has been in the news throughout the primary season , and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of " santorum . "	Santorum
How did [MASK] first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column ?	you
[MASK] do n't really remember .	We
[MASK] 's been around forever .	It
[MASK] 'll leave that to the professionals .	We
Do [MASK] think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column ?	you
[MASK] thought it was funny .	We
What [MASK] go in the Santorum cocktail ?	ingredients
Your Santorum cocktail [MASK] has already received media coverage from publications including ; The Brooklyn Paper , The New York Times , Jezebel , Metro.us , EDGE on the Net , and Instinct Magazine .	creation
Did [MASK] think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage ?	you
[MASK] were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy .	We
What culinary dishes would [MASK] recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail ?	you
[MASK] 'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time , so something sweet ; ice cream or pie .	You
Is the [MASK] popular ?	drink
How many times do [MASK] suppose you ’ve served it at your establishment since its creation ?	you
The [MASK] was mildly popular for the last few months , but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity .	drink
[MASK] have no way to estimate how many times we 've served it overall , but we 're now pouring around ten a night .	We
How did [MASK] come to be involved with this discovery	you
[MASK] Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone .	Frank
[MASK] was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea ?	What
[MASK] think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate , because it implies that there was a well - founded expectation of something .	I
The [MASK] that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like .	technology
Are [MASK] intending to go there yourself ?	you
[MASK] would love to .	I
But [MASK] am also happy to not go , as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf !	I
[MASK] I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways , but it does n't require me to be there .	What
Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship [MASK] is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there .	time
[MASK] of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ?	Some
The [MASK] we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) .	samples
The [MASK] is great for preserving structures , but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body .	formalin
[MASK] means we ca n't look at the issue you raise with these animals .	This
[MASK] can start that side of the work now , anticipating having more beasts in the future .	We
In terms of their glow , [MASK] suspect that it 's not theirs - although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , they do n't usually make light themselves .	I
[MASK] do make a host of florescent proteins , and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow .	They
What analysis did [MASK] perform on the specimens and what equipment was used ?	you
[MASK] used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60 X ) .	I
[MASK] embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome , mounted the slices on microscope slides , stained the slices to enhance contrast , and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope	I
( [MASK] 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) .	that
[MASK] used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) .	I
[MASK] compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group .	I
This [MASK] seems trivial , but it is really the most important part !	step
By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , [MASK] figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species .	I
[MASK] was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , why did it take so long ?	It
[MASK] mean , how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly , right ? :)	You
[MASK] was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out .	It
[MASK] of that time was just lost time - I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish .	Some
Once we figured out what it was , [MASK] played a lot of manuscript email tag , which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc.	we
Manuscript [MASK] and processing took about four months .	review
The [MASK] was not unorthodox - they followed best practices for anatomical preservation .	preservation
[MASK] am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones - the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually , and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction .	I
[MASK] is the only way to test this .	DNA
This [MASK] shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic , and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station	map
[MASK] explained how she obtained these images of the anemone 's anatomy .	Daly
Your [MASK] to this is probably primarily what you see in movies , scanning magazines , scanning the Internet , just snippets everywhere .	exposure
[MASK] 's up ?	What
[MASK] do wear a lot of black .	I
[MASK] 's anything but that .	It
[MASK] hire the opposite of what you 'd think we would hire , what the average person would think we would hire .	We
[MASK] hire educated , nice people .	We
[MASK] remember one of our ads that I had put in said , " If you think nice girls do n't do S&M , " -- I forgot what the rest of it said --	I
And that [MASK] had pulled so many girls , because they -- I think they all thought that nice girls do n't do this .	ad
And a [MASK] of them had called and they said , " Wow . "	bunch
And [MASK] think I remember , a bunch of guys called because of that also .	I
Do [MASK] remember ?	you
[MASK] sure do , I sure do .	I
[MASK] are the startup costs involved ?	What
[MASK] varies ; look around Manhattan , look around rents , look around build-outs , look around hiring , look around advertising ...	It
[MASK] 's your greatest non-fixed cost ?	What
The single most costly [MASK] we spend on is rent and advertising , those two together make up the bulk of what we spend .	thing
[MASK] 's about it .	That
The hardest [MASK] in running this business , which is why people ca n't do it , is the relationship that my wife has with the gals and with the customers .	thing
Where do [MASK] advertise ?	you
[MASK] constantly change their policy on it ; they want it , they do n't want it ...	Magazines
[MASK] 's buying the paper , who 's selling the paper .	Who
So [MASK] changes , so one year we got to be in the Press , but they have now stopped adult ads .	it
So now [MASK] 'll be in the Voice for a while .	we
[MASK] 're moving more towards the Internet at this point , because the Internet is a much easier , safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it .	We
Pursuant to your business question : [MASK] only hire nice people .	we
[MASK] do n't care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking --	I
My [MASK] has met beautiful , beautiful girls --	husband
-- and he 's in the end , [MASK] would say , " Well , I wo n't hire them . "	he
[MASK] 'm like , ‘ Are you insane ?	I
[MASK] wo n't hire them .	I
[MASK] hire --	I
Because [MASK] want someone who 's going to treat people nicely and well .	I
[MASK] have --	We
How can [MASK] tell whether they will or will not ?	you
And [MASK] 's been right .	he
And [MASK] have made him hire these girls , and ultimately he 's been right	I
[MASK] 've been complete pain in the asses !	They
[MASK] also have a profile they fill out for me , a mini-MMPI that I developed , so that I have an idea -- Rebecca and I put it together	I
[MASK] do n't know if you 'd like to see one .	I
[MASK] could show you .	I
So [MASK] have a mini-MMPI that I --	I
Could [MASK] have a sample , not necessarily one that 's filled out , but just one that you --	I
[MASK] 'll show you .	I
The [MASK] are --	questions
[MASK] 'll make you fill one out .	He
[MASK] 'd be scared .	You
[MASK] would n't hire me .	You
Is [MASK] only girls you hire ?	it
What would a [MASK] like " the greatest woman in the world " reveal to you ?	question
No [MASK] would reveal anything independently of all the questions together --	question
-- but [MASK] have a chart that I 'll go through ; the MMPI .	I
How did [MASK] originate these questions ?	you
Where did [MASK] make them ?	I
[MASK] get a baseline from asking girls and refining profiles --	You
And [MASK] 's an amalgamation of questions .	it
[MASK] 's your favorite question ?	What
[MASK] do n't know , the O.J. Simpson ….	I
Yeah , [MASK] see O.J. Simpson .	I
What would [MASK] be an indicator of ?	that
[MASK] 'm not sure which one you gave him , but there 's a brief , brief , brief IQ test there .	I
Do [MASK] ask for references ?	you
No , because [MASK] really ca n't call and tell them I 'm yeah , so - and - so 's applying here for a position .	I
[MASK] is a wiki - based site which aims to " build the world 's largest , highest quality how - to manual . "	wikiHow
[MASK] recently published its 50,000th article , and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation , Wikinews interviewed the site 's founder , Jack Herrick .	It
In the interview , [MASK] explains what wikiHow is , why he decided to create it , how he grew it in size , and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license ( HyperLink ) for his site .	Herrick
For our readers who are unaware of your site , could [MASK] briefly explain what wikiHow is ?	you
[MASK] is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how - to manual .	wikiHow
[MASK] 're quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger	We
[MASK] currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles .	We
[MASK] hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status .	We
That said , [MASK] are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve .	we
However , in terms of readership , [MASK] are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia .	we
[MASK] get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast .	We
Like Wikipedia , [MASK] is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software .	wikiHow
Our [MASK] is full of volunteers from all over the world .	community
That said , [MASK] are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects :	we
[MASK] are much smaller .	We
The English [MASK] has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia .	wikiHow
As a result , [MASK] is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors .	wikiHow
[MASK] has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation .	This
[MASK] show opt - out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations .	We
Our advertising [MASK] funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons .	revenue
In addition , [MASK] 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral .	we
As a result some [MASK] believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online .	folks
Why did [MASK] decide to create wikiHow ?	you
[MASK] think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person .	I
How much more could [MASK] accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ?	you
[MASK] think that building a universal how - to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world .	I
[MASK] is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful .	Knowledge
[MASK] 've been interested in building a comprehensive how - to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow .	I
My first [MASK] at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow .	attempt
[MASK] was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world .	eHow
[MASK] contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software .	eHow
This business [MASK] worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .	model
[MASK] either 1) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write .	You
[MASK] was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive .	I
So ultimately [MASK] decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned .	I
When I discovered Wikipedia , [MASK] recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how - to resource the world really needs .	I
So [MASK] decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .	I
Why did [MASK] decide to use a Creative Commons license ?	you
[MASK] use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) .	We
In my opinion , [MASK] should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . "	people
If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , [MASK] can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere .	they
[MASK] is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license .	This
This [MASK] to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community .	right
[MASK] believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far .	I
My hope is that over time , internet [MASK] will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others .	users
That said , when we started out [MASK] did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license .	I
As a result , [MASK] made some mistakes along the path .	we
In retrospect , [MASK] think we probably should have selected the CC BY - SA license instead of CC - BY - SA - NC .	I
At a minimum [MASK] would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .	this
[MASK] now has millions of visitors per month .	wikiHow
How did [MASK] grow the site to the size it is today ?	you
In December 2008 , [MASK] had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics ( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) .	wikiHow
[MASK] ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US .	Quantcast
[MASK] achieved this popularity for a few reasons .	wikiHow
First , [MASK] around the world are desperate for high quality how - to information .	people
[MASK] want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n't provide enough quality information yet .	People
Second , [MASK] attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing : We had some articles of mixed quality , and editors joined to improve those articles , which in turn attracted more readers .	we
[MASK] continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle : More readers , means more editors , which creates better instructions , leading again to more readers .	We
[MASK] is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed .	It
[MASK] interviews academic Simon Ličen about attitudes towards US Paralympics	Wikinews
On Thursday , with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi , Russia , [MASK] interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership , Sport Studies and Educational / Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Ličen about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics .	Wikinews
[MASK] has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents .	Ličen
Originally from Slovenia , [MASK] served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission .	he
[MASK] was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team .	He
Why do [MASK] think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ?	you
[MASK] in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society .	Sports
[MASK] emphasizes consumerism , the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications , and reinforces , rather than changes , existing ideas related to gender , ethnicity and nationality .	It
Paralympic [MASK] brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled .	sport
Although disability is not contagious , [MASK] in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it .	interest
Disabled [MASK] also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to .	athletes
Other [MASK] , including the ones you mention , have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society .	countries
Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act , many social [MASK] including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity .	institutions
What do [MASK] think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ?	you
The [MASK] depends on a number of aspects .	impact
[MASK] of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on .	One
A second [MASK] is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown .	aspect
A third important [MASK] is the way the event will be mediated : will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics ?	factor
Will [MASK] treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse ?	they
Will [MASK] take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity ?	they
All in all , [MASK] think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .	I
The LibriVox [MASK] features a catalog of about a hundred completed books , including books in other languages like German , Hebrew , and Japanese .	website
Why did [MASK] decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands , and how did you go about it ?	you
[MASK] think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world , and so I thought : here 's a way to help the cause .	I
[MASK] launched LibriVox , emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff , and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad 's Secret Agent .	I
[MASK] have grown steadily since .	Things
By the way , [MASK] was the first guy I know of to do something like this , with Lawrence Lessig 's Free Culture .	AKMA
[MASK] , I think , started my thinking about this , but it took a while for the idea to crystallize .	That
Do [MASK] personally record audiobooks , and did you already do so before LibriVox ?	you
[MASK] was my first experience recording audiobooks .	LibriVox
[MASK] still do the odd chapter , but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days !	I
My personal [MASK] is Notes from the Underground ( Dostoyevsky ) .	favourite
Browsing the catalog , [MASK] find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter .	I
If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they did n't like the speaker , would [MASK] then offer two versions ?	you
[MASK] take the Wikipedia approach : if you think it should be better , please help it be so .	We
[MASK] 'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books .	You
Indeed our weekly poetry [MASK] celebrates this diversity of voice : each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version , so you get 20 + versions of the same poem , a very interesting audio experience .	project
[MASK] mentioned Larry Lessig 's Free Culture , but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept , such as O'Reilly .	You
Do [MASK] want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works , or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well ?	you
[MASK] are only doing public domain works , for a number of reasons , partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means it s as simple as can be .	We
[MASK] makes things more complex .	CC
[MASK] find it makes things clear and easy to say : published works , public domain , and leave it at that .	we
As far as I can tell , [MASK] features " free as in beer " content — material which you can download , but which is n't under a free content license .	podiobooks.com
Instead of " public domain " , would n't " free [MASK] " work just as well , using something like the Free Content Definition to limit the scope ?	content
[MASK] needs more discussion obviously : we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we did n't want to add new restrictions , especially not non-commercial , since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects ( I ca n't recall any specific project names , but some pay - education sites use LV stuff ) .	This
[MASK] 's good and well and fine with us .	That
[MASK] do n't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings , we want anyone to use them for whatever they want .	We
Also , for the thing to work [MASK] need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management ( onerous ) and many willing to do the reading .	you
While Pride and Prejudice will attract many readers , [MASK] do n't know about O'Reilly 's latest tome on XML ... though I might be wrong .	I
On Saturday , [MASK] interviewed Tina McKenzie , a former member of the Australia women 's national wheelchair basketball team , known as the Gliders .	Wikinews
[MASK] , a silver and bronze Paralympic medalist in wheelchair basketball , retired from the game after the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London .	McKenzie
[MASK] caught up with her in a cafe in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Preston .	Wikinews
[ The Spitfire [MASK] in Canada ] was a really good tournament actually .	Tournament
[MASK] was a tournament that I wish we 'd actually gone back to more often .	It
[MASK] plays in that one ?	Who
[MASK] 's quite a large Canadian tournament , and so we went as the Gliders team .	It
So [MASK] were trying to get as many international games as possible .	we
Cause [MASK] 's one of our problems really , to compete .	that
And so [MASK] can compete against each other all the time within Australia but we really need to be able to ...	we
[MASK] 's not the same .	It
No , [MASK] 's really not , so it 's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year to continue our improvement .	it
But yes , [MASK] was good .	Spitfire
[MASK] took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005 , leading into the World Cup in the Netherlands .	We
Was [MASK] the one where you were the captain of the team , in 2005 ?	that
Or was [MASK] a later one ?	that
No , [MASK] captained in 2010 .	I
And then [MASK] had a bit of some time off in 2011 .	I
The [MASK] have never won the World Championship .	Gliders
[MASK] always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup .	We
[MASK] do n't know why .	I
[MASK] 's really strange occurrence , over the years .	It
2002 World Cup , [MASK] won bronze .	we
Then in 2006 [MASK] ended up fourth .	we
[MASK] was one of the worst World Cups we 've played actually .	It
And then in 2010 we just ... [MASK] do n't know what happened .	I
[MASK] just did n't play as well as we thought we would .	We
But [MASK] know what ?	you
So [MASK] can come back home and revisit what you need to do and , you know , where the team 's at .	you
Unfortunately , [MASK] are talking about moving it so it will be on the year before the Paralympics .	they
Well , [MASK] would be sad .	that
[MASK] have received a good deal of attention recently .	You
Even though I 'm not Michael Jackson or somebody , when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say , ' Hey Frank , my name is John , ' [MASK] say , ' Hey John , my name is Frank ' and they laugh .	I
[MASK] 's a funny phenomenon .	It
[MASK] goes through your head when that happens ?	What
[MASK] understand it .	I
[MASK] 've gone to readings and concerts .	I
[MASK] look at it as human interaction .	I
Over the years [MASK] have performed in 32 countries and 40 states .	I
[MASK] 've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties , and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses .	I
The [MASK] I started in 1993 , Spoken Motion , received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene .	band
[MASK] worked with some great musicians and performed around the world .	I
[MASK] remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old .	I
As time went on , [MASK] came out with books and CDs , and I became used to that kind of thing .	I
When [MASK] comes up and says , ' Frank , thank you , your work is great . "	someone
[MASK] have a long career in poetry , but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets - inspired work .	You
How do [MASK] feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work ?	you
[MASK] 's ironic .	It
[MASK] Whitman , the first great American poet , wrote about the Civil War .	Walt
[MASK] went looking for his brother , George Whitman , after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South .	He
Then [MASK] started to see the real horrors of war .	he
[MASK] was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time .	He
Eventually when he found his brother [MASK] had resolution .	he
[MASK] experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer .	I
[MASK] loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero .	I
[MASK] turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now .	I
When I wrote my 9/11 - related poems , [MASK] was true adversity .	that
[MASK] realize baseball is just a game .	I
Can [MASK] recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now ?	you
[MASK] was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza , but it 's about preparation for a battle , and being prepared to either rise to the occasion , or go down :	This
Do [MASK] know what it 's like to be chased by the Ghost of Failure while staring through Victory 's door ?	you
Of course you do , [MASK] 're a Mets fan caught in a do - or - die moment in late September at Shea	you
[MASK] 've kept it up this long	you
[MASK] 're a Mets fan in late September and you ll fight til the glorious end	You
Have [MASK] had interaction with " new readers ' through your Mets work ?	you
This one [MASK] who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail .	person
The [MASK] said , ' Frank , I have never bothered you during the game , but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work . '	e-mail
Last year in my section at the stadium [MASK] had a banner that read We Know ' .	I
[MASK] 's all it said .	That
Then earlier this year these [MASK] started to come out that said , " Poet says We Know " .	shirts
[MASK] was amazing .	It
[MASK] did n't use the banner this year , though , because we did n't know .	We
The [MASK] was n't so far ahead that we knew .	team
Last year [MASK] just knew we were going to the playoffs ; we knew we were going post-season .	we
This year [MASK] were n't sure .	we
[MASK] were walking on eggshells .	We
Last year [MASK] came up to me during one of the games late in the season ; she was so happy we were going to the post season .	she
By that point [MASK] had clinched it .	we
[MASK] handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug .	She
With tears in her eyes [MASK] said , " Thank you , Mets Poet , thank you . "	she
[MASK] 's cool ... it 's like another family .	It
[MASK] like that must make you realize you have touched people who are n't normally touched by poetry .	Moments
[MASK] 's opened up a new fan base , so to speak .	It
For the last year [MASK] has broadcast footage of me with my poems , so quite a few fans known about the " Mets Poet ' .	SNY
[MASK] have never called myself that , by the way .	I
The [MASK] of my jersey says " The Poet ' because growing up that was my nickname .	back
My [MASK] was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman -- Birdie -- and they called me The Poet .	brother
[MASK] was a natural thing , but I never coined myself as ' The Mets Poet . '	It
This exclusive [MASK] features first - hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter .	interview
How do [MASK] decide on the stories ?	you
[MASK] do everything backwards here .	We
[MASK] start with the headline and then flesh out the story , as opposed to The New York Times , which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy .	We
[MASK] start with a joke .	We
[MASK] read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core .	We
[MASK] whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred , come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ; all fifteen of us .	We
Then [MASK] assign a headline to a specific writer to execute .	we
[MASK] go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team , who adds the visual aspect to it .	We
The [MASK] punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition .	editors
So [MASK] do n’t have writers coming up with a story and headline , but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved ?	you
[MASK] will occasionally write their own headlines , but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas , what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people ’s writing strengths are .	Writers
[MASK] have some people who are great at politics ; some people we give all the war stuff to ; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week — the entertainment stories .	We
[MASK] are a little less reactionary .	We
[MASK] tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything .	We
[MASK] ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world .	We
[MASK] ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney .	We
In an interview with Terry Gross , [MASK] Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes .	Stephen
[MASK] felt it was overdone , mean - spirited and not funny .	They
Do your [MASK] have similar rules of thumb ?	writers
[MASK] do n’t have any rules or known lines we wo n’t cross .	We
[MASK] have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years , and those writers training the new writers as they come in .	We
If it makes the room laugh , [MASK] probably ends up in the paper .	it
One example is [MASK] ran an article a couple of years back that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " .	we
[MASK] was our reaction to all of the J - Lo stuff .	That
[MASK] were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating .	We
[MASK] think it ’s important we have an original take on those things .	I
[MASK] think it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross .	I
[MASK] do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle .	We
The [MASK] has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes .	Onion
[MASK] want an original take .	We
If we choose to do something on J - Lo , [MASK] ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious .	it
When you are going through the headlines , is [MASK] just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up ?	it
[MASK] ’s the least amount of fun possible .	It
Nah , [MASK] ’m kidding .	I
[MASK] ’s actually more businesslike than you ’d imagine .	It
It ’s very much like [MASK] are trying to make the room laugh , but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now , so it takes a lot to make the room laugh .	you
The best [MASK] I ’ve heard is when Rob Siegel , former editor - in - chief , likened it to wine tasting .	analogy
[MASK] ’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is , have we done anything like this , is it a unique take , what are other people doing .	It
It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... [MASK] ’s hilarious . That ’s really really funny " rather than people falling off their chairs .	that
[MASK] ’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect .	It
[MASK] ’s more analytical and clinical ?	It
Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , [MASK] are scripted writers rooms .	those
[MASK] is funny there .	Everything
If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes , do [MASK] eventually fire them ?	you
[MASK] ’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out .	That
[MASK] can be a real mess on Broadway .	It
By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though , the odds are [MASK] are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging .	you
[MASK] go through quite a bit .	You
[MASK] will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis .	You
" The [MASK] is only peace . The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for . "	future
Mr. President , as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel , do [MASK] still think that there is a future to the peace process ?	you
The [MASK] is only peace .	future
The problem is how long will [MASK] take and how many victims will it call for .	it
Why do [MASK] say peace ?	I
Because when you look historically , at the development of humanity , most of our lives [MASK] are living on the land .	we
The reason for it is because [MASK] were fighting for our land , either defending it or extending it , because that was the main source .	people
The land , the natural resources , the markets , all [MASK] go together .	these
[MASK] can not conquer science .	Armies
[MASK] can not check what a scientist has in his mind , they can see what he has in his pocket but not what he has in his mind so it ’s uncontrolled ; it means that borders are n’t important and distances are n’t important .	Customs
How do [MASK] approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when , in the end , they do n’t want Israel to exist .	you
How do [MASK] come to an understanding to make peace possible ?	you
Well , [MASK] is the problem ?	what
[MASK] mean , is the problem national , say between Jews and Arabs ; or is it a matter of generations between an old age and a new age ?	I
You see , the [MASK] are protesting against modernity .	terrorists
[MASK] think that modernity may endanger their tradition .	They
[MASK] are simply afraid and hate modernity .	They
[MASK] consider modernity as their enemy , but then they have two problems .	They
First of all , can [MASK] exist on tradition ?	they
[MASK] can not .	They
Sooner or later [MASK] will have to enter the new age .	they
All the talks about nationalities , etcetera , well , the new [MASK] has very little patience for history .	age
[MASK] is becoming more and more irrelevant .	History
How do [MASK] feel about that ?	you
Well , [MASK] distinguish between two histories , the spiritual and the material .	I
The [MASK] of values is okay because wisdom is ageless ; it does n’t grow old , like material .	history
But [MASK] are totally unimportant for 2 reasons .	events
First , the [MASK] is unimportant .	event
Why should [MASK] bother my children with all this nonsense ?	I
What sort of a nose did [MASK] have ?	Cleopatra
God , [MASK] do n’t know !	I
[MASK] can invite people to war over noses , but nobody will go to fight for noses any more .	You
Why should [MASK] bother my child with memory when he can buy a computer that will remember everything you asked him to remember ?	I
Although a [MASK] can have …	computer
Look , the new [MASK] is unprecedented .	age
When something is unprecedented , [MASK] means it does n’t have a past , does n’t have a history .	it
And [MASK] dwells in the past , does n’t understand the future because the past is full of prejudices , of commitments .	whoever
[MASK] arrests us .	It
And then [MASK] say you wo n’t commit a mistake , so you ’ll commit new mistakes .	you
[MASK] does n’t matter .	It
`` [MASK] say brains is the greater producer of wealth , not oil .	I
[MASK] ’s limitless , and you ’ll see that the GNP of Israel is very close to the Saudis ’ .	It
So [MASK] are 3 times larger than us and they have all the oil in the world .	they
[MASK] have brains . "	We
— Peres , on whether the Arab states ' oil [MASK] will eclipse Israel 's prominence in the region .	wealth
So [MASK] will make new mistakes .	they
[MASK] is inevitable as long as there are human beings .	Mistake
But [MASK] can not repeat mistakes because the world is not built on repetition ; it ’s built on mutation .	you
Do n’t [MASK] think Darfur is repetition ?	you
[MASK] think Darfur is , again , the last , or among the last battles between old and new .	I
What are [MASK] fighting for ?	they
What are [MASK] killing killing killing over ?	they
[MASK] do n’t carry futures .	They
[MASK] ’s not a mistake .	It
[MASK] belongs to a past .	It
[MASK] does n’t have a moment .	It
[MASK] am sure that the reasons for war are over , even though still there are wars which are an inertia from the past , a continuation that does n’t make sense .	I
[MASK] ’m answering your question .	I
[MASK] ’s not a geographic endeavor , it is an intellectual endeavor .	It
[MASK] say you can be Muslim and modern .	They
[MASK] interviews Israeli mathematician and writer Aner Shalev	Wikinews
[MASK] Shalev is an Israeli mathematician and writer born in 1958 in Kibbutz Kinneret , Tiberias .	Aner
Currently [MASK] is a Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem 's Einstein Institute of Mathematics .	Shalev
At the moment [MASK] is in Levico Terme , Trento , Italy for a conference .	Shalev
What are [MASK] going to talk about here in Levico ?	you
[MASK] called it Character , walks and words .	I
It 's very beautiful [MASK] think .	I
And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like [MASK] do n't look at the small details .	you
[MASK] 's like from the sky .	It
[MASK] look at the general patterns .	You
So [MASK] will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory .	I
Why did [MASK] choose to study mathematics ?	you
First of all because [MASK] was beautiful .	it
When I was ten my [MASK] already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent .	father
[MASK] also like the freedom in mathematics .	I
If you study physics or chemistry then [MASK] should describe the real world .	you
But in mathematics [MASK] can build your own structures .	you
[MASK] can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people .	You
[MASK] 's almost like God to some extent .	It
You can create worlds , [MASK] can study them .	you
[MASK] think it 's a combination of the beauty , of the imagination , of the freedom .	I
Many [MASK] , and many students , dislike math .	people
Why do [MASK] think it is so ?	you
First of all [MASK] think maybe they have bad teachers , which is a problem .	I
[MASK] have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it .	You
Probably some [MASK] mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom , and the imagination , and creation .	people
Maybe [MASK] do n't like the precise nature of mathematics .	they
Also when I talk mathematics [MASK] notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they do n't know how to write a composition .	I
[MASK] have ideas but they can not formulate them in the right way .	They
Actually [MASK] find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world , but you can also create worlds of fiction .	I
So [MASK] have imagination , you have total freedom , you can invent characters , you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another .	you
Also the [MASK] is important in writing and in literature .	language
So in a way [MASK] often do n't know how to combine the two fields .	people
[MASK] could look like almost the opposite : literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers .	It
For example the most [MASK] is Lewis Carrol , author of Alice in Wonderland .	famous
[MASK] 're not only a mathematician .	You
[MASK] also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel .	You
Why did [MASK] begin to write ?	you
When I was quite young [MASK] was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams .	I
[MASK] was trying to interpret my dreams .	I
[MASK] started to write down my dreams .	I
And then [MASK] noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down .	I
Sometimes I make them more pretty then [MASK] were actually .	they
So instead of documenting the dreams [MASK] gradually became also like adding creational elements , and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing , also poems , but mainly stories .	it
In the legato part the [MASK] are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness .	sentences
In the staccato part [MASK] 's like a music : a lot of break , very very short sentences .	it
[MASK] was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people .	It
In the second book [MASK] made another experiment .	I
[MASK] 's a book of opening , Overtures I called it , and there is no end to the stories .	It
In the novel Dark Matters [MASK] think what interested me in the structure was two thing : simple narrative and email .	I
[MASK] keeps changing between narrative and email .	It
Another [MASK] was two different time scapes : one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end .	thing
[MASK] 's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle .	It
... love [MASK] and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot .	story
Why did [MASK] choose this particular structure ?	you
When I tell stories [MASK] do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning .	I
[MASK] like that something will be a bit of secret , or even unreliable narrator : someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything .	I
I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam , [MASK] kind of confront them , their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told .	I
[MASK] think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on .	I
[MASK] is a NASA space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild ( also known as " Wild 2 ) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15 , 2006 .	Stardust
Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home , [MASK] @ home relies entirely on human intelligence .	Stardust
[MASK] Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home .	Andrew
[MASK] interviewed him for May 's Interview of the Month ( IOTM ) on May 18 , 2006 .	Wikinews
[MASK] may not know exactly what Stardust or Stardust @ home is .	Some
Can [MASK] explain more about it for us ?	you
[MASK] is a NASA Discovery mission that was launched in 1999 .	Stardust
[MASK] is really two missions in one .	It
[MASK] is the first US " sample return " mission since Apollo , and the first ever from beyond the moon .	This
[MASK] gives a little context .	This
By " sample return " of course [MASK] mean a mission that brings back extraterrestrial material .	I
[MASK] should have said above that this is the first " solid " sample return mission —	I
[MASK] brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago , but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium —	Genesis
basically [MASK] is a sample of the Galaxy .	this
[MASK] is absolutely unprecedented , and we 're obviously incredibly excited .	This
[MASK] should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video — taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website — highly recommended — best I 've ever seen — all the way from the launch pad , too .	I
Is the [MASK] available to the public ?	video
OK , [MASK] digress .	I
[MASK] is a big challenge because they are very small ( order of micron in size ) and are somewhere ( we do n't know where ) on a HUGE collector — at least on the scale of the particle size — about a tenth of a square meter .	This
[MASK] 're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center .	We
[MASK] is the ARES group that handles returned samples ( Moon Rocks , Genesis chips , Meteorites , and Interplanetary Dust Particles collected by U2 in the stratosphere ) .	This
The [MASK] collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array .	microscope
[MASK] @ home is a highly distributed project using a " Virtual Microscope " that is written in html and javascript and runs on most browsers — no downloads are required .	Stardust
Using the Virtual Microscope [MASK] can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles .	volunteers
How many samples do [MASK] anticipate being found during the course of the project ?	you
The short answer is that [MASK] do n't know .	we
The long [MASK] is a bit more complicated .	answer
The Galileo and Ulysses [MASK] carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system .	spacecraft
( [MASK] is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust , caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . )	This
[MASK] Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind .	Markus
[MASK] estimated that there should be around 45 particles , but this number is very uncertain — I would n't be surprised if it is quite different from that .	He
[MASK] was the long answer !	That
One thing that I should say ... is that like all research , the [MASK] of what we are doing is highly uncertain .	outcome
[MASK] expect that the particles will be of order a micron in size .	We
When people are searching using the virtual microscope , [MASK] will be looking not for the particles , but for the tracks that the particles make , which are much larger — several microns in diameter .	they
Just yesterday [MASK] switched over to a new site which has a demo of the VM ( virtual microscope ) I invite you to check it out .	we

Local [MASK] in Italy ask taxes from religious schools	municipalities
In the past few days in Italy , several [MASK] have started asking religious schools to pay taxes for property and local services , despite the resistance of the Catholic Church .	municipalities
The [MASK] of the municipalities results from the sentence of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on July 8 , recognising as legitimate the request of the Municipality of Livorno asking religious schools to pay property taxes .	request
[MASK] have come from the Municipality of Bogliasco , next to Genova , and from the deputies of Movimento 5 Stelle ( M5S ) of the regional counsel of Lombardy .	Requests
The first [MASK] is of the mayor Luca Pastorino that in last years received several refusals of his requests for payment because of the religious nursery school and retirement home .	case
In the second case , the M5S [MASK] asks to the regional government to assure the local administrations of the region regularly apply the sentence of the Supreme Court .	party
The [MASK] on which the Court has ruled was of the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata in Livorno , Tuscany , to pay over 422,000 euros in arrears for the period from 2004 to 2009 .	case
The [MASK] reasoned , " because the users of the private schools pay a frequency fee , this kind of activity is considered as a commercial one " ( ( it ) ) .	city
In 2014 the Italian municipal tax [MASK] has changed from the ICI system to the IMU system by the Monti government .	discipline
The new [MASK] is not retroactive , so the taxes requested in arrears from 2006 to 2009 are under the ICI system .	law

This past [MASK] marked the opening night of an Andy Warhol exhibit at the University of Southern Indiana .	week
USI 's art [MASK] , like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country , is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program , and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol 's photographic legacy .	gallery
Wikinews [MASK] attended the opening and spoke to donors , exhibit organizers and patrons .	reporters
The USI art [MASK] celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol 's Polaroids , gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints .	gallery
USI 's [MASK] , which is located in Evansville , Indiana , is to run from January 23 through March 9 .	exhibit
The McCutchan Art [MASK] / Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection .	Center
The Andy Warhol [MASK] for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections , in 2007 and a second recently .	Foundation
[MASK] Waters , director of the gallery , expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future .	Kathryn
Since 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy [MASK] has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 Andy Warhol photographs and other artifacts .	Program
The [MASK] takes a decentralized approach to Warhol 's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol 's artistic vision , especially in the area of photography .	program
[MASK] provides additional video , audio and photographs so our readers may learn more .	Wikinews
[MASK] observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program , which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol 's death in 1987 .	Wilkins
[MASK] was not alone in receiving a donation .	USI
[MASK] Maurer , chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation , said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations .	K.C.
[MASK] have received Polaroids from the foundation .	All
University [MASK] can reach out and attract large audiences .	exhibits
For example , the Weatherspoon Art [MASK] at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010 , according to curator Elaine Gustafon .	Museum
That [MASK] was part of a collaboration combining the collections from Duke University , located in Durham , North Carolina , and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program .	exhibit
Each [MASK] donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well - known celebrities .	collection
The successful UNC Greensboro [MASK] included Polaroids of author Truman Capote and singer - songwriter Carly Simon .	exhibit
[MASK] explained Warhol 's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life .	Wilkins
" He 's hanging out with the celebrities , and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career " , [MASK] said .	Wilkins
The [MASK] at USI includes Polaroids of actor Dennis Hopper ; musician Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran ; publishers Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine and Carlo De Benedetti of Italy 's la Repubblica ; disco club owner Steve Rubell of Studio 54 ; photographers Nat Finkelstein , Christopher Makos and Felice Quinto ; and athletes Vitas Gerulaitis ( tennis ) and Jack Nicklaus ( golf ) .	exhibit
[MASK] observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer Halston , a former resident of Evansville .	Wikinews
University [MASK] across the United States also include Polaroids of " unknowns " who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame .	collections
[MASK] Thompson , curator and director of exhibits at the University of Arkansas , Fayetteville , said , " These images serve as documentation of people in his every day life and art - one which many of us enjoy a glimpse into . "	Cynthia
[MASK] was close to important touchstones of the 1960s , including art , music , consumer culture , fashion , and celebrity worship , which were all buzzwords and images Wikinews observed at USI 's opening exhibit .	Warhol
[MASK] was also an influential figure in the pop art movement .	He
" Pop art was about what popular American culture really thought was important " , [MASK] Waters said .	Kathryn
" [MASK] 's why he did the Campbell Soup cans or the Marilyn pictures , these iconic products of American culture whether they be in film , video or actually products we consumed .	That
So even back in the sixties , [MASK] was very aware of this part of our culture .	he
[MASK] as we all know in 2014 , has only increased probably a thousand fold . "	Which
" I think everybody knows Andy Warhol 's name , even non-art people , that 's a name they might know because he was such a personality " , [MASK] said .	Water
[MASK] Braysmith , USI associate professor of art history , said , " I think his photography is equally influential as his graphic works , his more famous pictures of Marilyn .	Hilary
In terms of the evolution of photography and experimentation , like painting on them or the celebrity fascination , [MASK] think he was really ground - breaking in that regard . "	I
The Polaroid [MASK] is not what made Warhol famous , however , he is in the company of other well - known photographers who used the camera , such as Ansel Adams , Chuck Close , Walker Evans , Robert Mapplethorpe , and Helmut Newton .	format
[MASK] said , " [ Warhol ] liked the way photo booths and the Polaroid 's front flash looked " .	Wilkins
[MASK] explained how Warhol 's adoption of the Polaroid camera revealed his process .	She
According to Wilkins , [MASK] was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it , which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further .	Warhol
[MASK] of the silk screens exhibited at USI this time was the Annie Oakley screen print called " Cowboys and Indians " from 1987 .	One
[MASK] also said Warhol was both an artist and a businessperson .	Wilkins
" As a way to commercialize his work , [MASK] would make a blue Marilyn and a pink Marilyn and a yellow Marilyn , and then you could pick your favorite color and buy that .	he
[MASK] was a very practical salesman approach to his work .	It
[MASK] was very prolific but very business minded about that . "	He
" He wanted to be rich and famous and he made lots of choices to go that way " , [MASK] said .	Wilkins
[MASK] Perkins , a second year USI art major , admitted she was willing to skip class Thursday night to attend the opening exhibit but then circumstances allowed for her to attend the exhibit .	Kiara
Why did [MASK] so badly want to attend ?	she
" [MASK] 's Warhol .	It
[MASK] is a legend . "	He
For Kevin Allton , a USI instructor in English , [MASK] was also a legend .	Warhol
[MASK] said , " Andy Warhol was the center of the Zeitgeist for the 20th century and everything since .	He
[MASK] is a post-modern diety . "	He
[MASK] said he had only seen the Silver Clouds installation before in film .	Allton
The Silver Clouds [MASK] were silver balloons blown up with helium , and those balloons filled one of the smaller rooms in the gallery .	installation
" I thought that in real life it was really kind of magical , " [MASK] said .	Allton
" [MASK] smacked them around . "	I
In her opening remarks for attendees , [MASK] pointed out those features to attendees , noting the touches of the Warhol Factory , or the studio where he worked , that were present around them .	Waters
[MASK] pointed to the refreshment table with Campbell 's Soup served with " electric " Kool Aid and tables adorned with colorful gumball " pills " .	She
The [MASK] in the background was from such bands as The Velvet Underground .	music
The big [MASK] of the evening , Wikinews observed from the long line , was the Polaroid - room where attendees could wear a Warhol - like wig or don crazy glasses and have their own Polaroid taken .	hit
The [MASK] were ready in an instant and immediately displayed at the entry of the exhibit .	Polaroids
Exhibit [MASK] then became part of the very exhibit they had wanted to attend .	goers
In fact , many [MASK] Wikinews observed took out their mobiles as they left for the evening and used their own phone cameras to make one further record of the moment - a photo of a photo .	people
Perhaps [MASK] had learned an important lesson from the Warhol exhibit that cultural events like these were ripe for use and reuse .	they
[MASK] might even call these exit instant snap shots , the self selfie .	We
[MASK] analyse effects of global warming , atmospheric ozone on crops	Scientists
A research [MASK] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 - 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat , rice , maize and soybean .	team
The [MASK] found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10 % of 2000 levels , substantially decreasing food security , in all cases examined .	scientists
[MASK] estimated by 2050 , increasing population and changing diet would increase world food needs by 50 percent .	They
As coauthor Colette Heald told The Huffington Post , " The climate [MASK] are quite consistent [...]	projections
the [MASK] of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [ of climate change ] on crops " .	future
By 2050 , [MASK] would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent , depending on the scenario .	undernourishment
The [MASK] focuses on ozone - temperature covariation : ground - level ozone increases with temperatures .	study
[MASK] said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields , " nobody has looked at these together " .	Heald
Depending on region and crops , the [MASK] may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone , providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation .	yields
The U.S. [MASK] of Agriculture notes , " Ground - level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants combined " , highlighting the importance of air quality for agriculture .	Department
[MASK] of NCLAN studies , published in a paper by AS Heagle in 1989 , show dicot species , such as soybean , cotton , and peanut , lose more yield from ozone than do monocot species such as sorghum , field corn , and winter wheat .	Results
The [MASK] found that ozone pollution caused 46 percent of previously heat - attributed damage to soybean crops .	researchers
The [MASK] does not include the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration , which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply .	model
The U.S. Environmental Protection [MASK] says some crops may have higher yields with increased levels of carbon dioxide .	Agency
However , global [MASK] also increases probability of extreme crops - damaging weather events such as floods , droughts , and extreme temperatures .	warming
Climate [MASK] affects distribution of weeds , pests , and diseases .	change
[MASK] noted the findings show pollution reduction is also important .	Heald
" An air - quality [MASK] would improve crop yields [...]	cleanup
[MASK] is something that we understand the causes of , and the steps that need to be taken to improve air quality . "	Ozone
As Heald told The Huffington Post , US surface [MASK] has dropped partly due to the Clean Air Act .	ozone
" Despite an increase in vehicle miles driven and energy consumption , surface [MASK] has declined by 25 percent on average across the U.S. from 1980 to 2012 [...]	ozone
However , the [MASK] of ozone air quality in the U.S. and around the world will depend on local emissions , the use of pollution control technology , regulations , and air quality policy . "	future
Greek [MASK] rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal	court

[MASK] believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO standards , to the benefit of regional stability and security .	We
[MASK] remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society .	We
The [MASK] of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions , as well as the relevant documents of regional organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , in which we are playing a very active role .	Government
[MASK] will continue to do so in the future as well .	We
By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming a party to other recently adopted international instruments on human rights , [MASK] has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups , especially women , children , persons in need and minorities , among others .	Albania
In recent years , the Albanian [MASK] has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration .	Government
[MASK] , as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration , remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals , which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development .	Albania
The [MASK] of our sustained economic growth , which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year , is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime .	pattern
[MASK] would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their valuable assistance in support of the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level .	I
The Albanian [MASK] is pleased to note that an ever - healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South - Eastern European region .	Government
In implementing this policy , [MASK] is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant , opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade agreements and free movement corridors , and stimulating foreign direct investment .	Albania
[MASK] are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking .	We

When I tour around Taiwan , of course , [MASK] also find people taking action without even waiting for the ministries to take action .	I
[MASK] is another of the g0v projects the environmental agency .	This
If you change the O to a zero , [MASK] get into them , considering environmental agency .	you
[MASK] is what people care about , the air quality , PM 2.5 in Taiwan .	This
More than 2,000 [MASK] , actually , installed these in their balconies , in their schools and so on , to get a real - time sensor of their IoT devices but not just IoT .	people
[MASK] also upload it to the public cloud , which then uploads it to a distributed ledger to make sure that nobody can modify those numbers after the fact .	They
After that , [MASK] see this kind of innovation is very rare in Asia .	we
When I talk to all the UN - related bodies , many other Asian [MASK] tell me that they wo n't let this network grow to be 2,000 nodes strong .	countries
If it 's 200 nodes strong , [MASK] will try to poach the leader to the government .	they
If the environmental agency group reports one number and your neighbors report another number , of course , [MASK] 're going to trust the one that you participated yourself , even though it 's a lower quality sensor .	you
Because of that , [MASK] 's very rare in Taiwan because we have an expanding civic space .	it
The [MASK] takes the approach of , " we ca n't beat them , let 's join them " .	government
[MASK] manufacture low - cost , high - precision sensors for them , but we also see this as a map of digital gap in Taiwan , a digital divide .	We
[MASK] set up points when the people do n't have the resource to go to , indigenous places , places in the mountains .	We
[MASK] also talk to the citizen scientists and they say they really want a point here to tell the air pollution from outside Taiwan or from inside Taiwan , domestically .	We
[MASK] can because we have wind turbines .	We
[MASK] 's electricity generators , power plants , over there .	That
[MASK] can install those sensor networks as part of the complementary action .	We
The [MASK] is this , it 's all open hardware .	beauty
[MASK] 's all open source .	It
[MASK] 's on GitHub .	It
[MASK] just download , put it onto Raspberry Pi , and then , you can do it yourself , as people have done over the world .	You
If you do n't change the source code , [MASK] uploads to the Taiwan network by default , so we kind of have the numbers of all the atmosphere and meteorological data .	it
[MASK] have a website dedicated for this , the Civil IoT project at CI.taiwan.gov.tw , that is basically , collective intelligence , meteorological , air quality , earthquake , and disaster prevention , and things like that .	We
[MASK] have single websites like this , CI for Collective Intelligence , AI for AI Taiwan , SI for Social Innovation , Smart Taiwan for the Smart Taiwan plan , and also , Bio Taiwan .	We
The medical [MASK] says , " You really should call it biomed.taiwan because bio and med are different things . "	industry
Biomed [MASK] goes to the same website as Bio Taiwan .	Taiwan
In any case , [MASK] we 're doing is now is breaking across ministry and municipality and national government because this says nothing about the level of the government or the departments .	what
[MASK] is one , single message that is collaboratively curated by everybody .	It
Through this , [MASK] solved not just our local social and environmental issues through economic approaches but using the SDGs as a map to unite the efforts together .	we
Just by saying " Taiwan can help " , [MASK] mean specifically , 17 , 18 , which is the availability of reliable data that people from across sectors , across jurisdictions , can trust the data .	we
Then , based on the data , [MASK] encourage cross-sectoral partnerships .	we
Then , based on that , [MASK] make open innovations that we , then , export , not as colonizers but , really , co-creators .	we
When I joined the cabinet two years ago , based on these ideas -- with a contract -- the [MASK] asked me for a job description , because they 've never seen anything like this before .	administration
Instead of a job description , [MASK] just wrote them a poem , a prayer , which I 'm going to read to you as a conclusion .	I
To me , [MASK] means the shift from IT or ICT to digital , the shift from the sectors separately as attack or an innovation , or whatever , into the humanity as a whole .	it

[MASK] may be beyond us , but as long as there are tears and suffering , so long our work will not be over .	That
And so [MASK] have to labour and to work , and to work hard , to give reality to our dreams .	we
Those [MASK] are for India , but they are also for the world , for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart .	dreams
To the people of India , whose representatives we are , [MASK] make an appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure .	we

On this day our first [MASK] go to the architect of this freedom , the Father of our Nation , who , embodying the old spirit of India , held aloft the torch of freedom and lighted up the darkness that surrounded us .	thoughts
[MASK] have often been unworthy followers of his and have strayed from his message , but not only we but succeeding generations will remember this message and bear the imprint in their hearts of this great son of India , magnificent in his faith and strength and courage and humility .	We
[MASK] shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out , however high the wind or stormy the tempest .	We
Our next [MASK] must be of the unknown volunteers and soldiers of freedom who , without praise or reward , have served India even unto death .	thoughts
[MASK] think also of our brothers and sisters who have been cut off from us by political boundaries and who unhappily can not share at present in the freedom that has come .	We
[MASK] are of us and will remain of us whatever may happen , and we shall be sharers in their good [ or ] ill fortune alike .	They
The [MASK] beckons to us .	future
Whither do [MASK] go and what shall be our endeavour ?	we

[MASK] thank the gentleman from New York , the distinguished Chair of the Judiciary Committee , for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the Floor .	I
And [MASK] commend Congresswoman Karen Bass , Madam Chair , for your great leadership in this important legislation .	I
Madam Speaker , nearly one year ago , [MASK] Floyd gasped his last words , ‘ I ca n't breathe , ’ and ignited a nationwide reckoning on the racial injustice and police brutality in America .	George
[MASK] from every corner of the country took to the streets to peacefully protest violence against Black Americans , waving Black Lives Matter flags , chanting the names of the murdered , repeating George Floyd 's dying words , ‘ I ca n't breathe . ’	Americans
[MASK] turned their agony into action , but tragically , despite these mass protests , the injustice , killings continued .	They
Those [MASK] were global .	protests
[MASK] were all over the world .	They
Here , as Members of Congress and as Americans , [MASK] can not accept this epidemic of injustice .	we
[MASK] can not stay silent when one – when our most vulnerable and historically marginalized communities , people of color , those living in poverty , Americans with disabilities are being targeted and sometimes killed .	We
[MASK] is why , today , the House will again pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and send it to the Senate and the President 's desk so that it can finally become the law of the land .	That
[MASK] salute Congresswoman Karen Bass who has been relentless , persistent and absolutely courageous in her leadership on this legislation .	I
The George Floyd Justice in Policing [MASK] fundamentally transforms the culture of policing with strong , unprecedented reforms .	Act
This [MASK] will not erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing in America .	legislation
[MASK] will not bring back George Floyd , Breonna Taylor – say her name , Breonna Taylor – Ahmaud Arbery , or the countless other men and women who died or were senselessly injured .	It
But [MASK] will make a tremendous – take a tremendous step toward – or to stop the violence , stem the suffering and start to build a healthier , better relationship between law enforcement and communities that they respect .	it
[MASK] of us here salute and are proudly , profoundly grateful to our law enforcement heroes .	All
[MASK] grew up in a family , public service family .	I
My [MASK] , my whole life at home , was Mayor of Baltimore .	father
My [MASK] was Mayor later , Thomas D’Alesandro , in Baltimore .	brother
And [MASK] had a motto about the police : ‘ Be true to the men in blue . ’	they
Of course [MASK] was a long time ago and they were all men .	this
[MASK] of us here , again , salute and profoundly grateful for our law enforcement heroes .	All
As the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives writes , ‘ The [MASK] of this act is paramount in achieving the fundamental principle of a police force that protects and serves every citizen of their community with fairness , accountability and transparency in their actions . ’	passage
The Democratic [MASK] , together with the Biden - Harris Administration , is committed to not only ensuring that this legislation becomes law , but to take further action to end violence and advance justice in America .	Congress
[MASK] could n't be in your committee room because of COVID , but they came and they asked me that day , they said , ‘ Madam Speaker , will you name this bill for our brother ? ’	We
[MASK] , his brother , asked that question .	Philonise
[MASK] said , ‘ Only if you think it is worthy of your brother . ’	I
[MASK] think of George Floyd at least once a day – sometimes more .	I
And [MASK] know why ?	you
As I 'm washing my hands for 20 seconds , after about eight or nine seconds , [MASK] 'm thinking	I
‘ [MASK] is taking forever .	This
[MASK] ca n't do this for 20 seconds .	I
[MASK] takes too long . ’	It
And then [MASK] think of George Floyd .	I
[MASK] 's a long time .	That
[MASK] 's a long time , as Congresswoman Dean said , calling out for his mother , extending love to his family .	It
With that , Madam Speaker , [MASK] urge a strong , bipartisan vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act .	I
[MASK] thank Karen Bass again , Madam Chair .	I
And [MASK] yield back the balance of my time .	I
The [MASK] of the United Nations sends a clear message to us all : put people first .	Charter
The first [MASK] of the Charter , “ We the peoples ” , are a summons to place people at the centre of our work — every day , everywhere .	words
Those [MASK] are not a favour to be rewarded or withheld ; they are an endowment for simply being human .	rights
Throughout the first half of my mandate , [MASK] have had the good fortune to meet people around the world , not in gilded meeting rooms but where they live , work and dream .	I
And [MASK] have listened .	I
[MASK] have heard families in the South Pacific who fear their lives being swept away by rising seas ; young refugees in the Middle East yearning for a return to school and home ; Ebola survivors in North Kivu struggling to rebuild their lives ; women demanding equality and opportunity ; people of all beliefs and traditions who suffer simply because of who they are ; and so many others .	I
[MASK] are living in a world of disquiet .	We
A great many [MASK] fear getting trampled , thwarted , left behind .	people
[MASK] take their jobs , traffickers take their dignity , demagogues take their rights , warlords take their lives , fossil fuels take their futures .	Machines
And yet [MASK] believe in the spirit and ideas that bring us to this Hall .	people
[MASK] believe in the United Nations .	They
But do [MASK] believe in us ?	they
Do [MASK] believe that , as leaders , we will put people first ?	they
[MASK] the leaders must deliver for we the peoples .	We
[MASK] have the right to live in peace .	People
One year ago in this Hall , [MASK] spoke of winds of hope despite the chaos and confusion of our world ( see A/73/PV.6 ) .	I
Since then , [MASK] of those currents have continued to move in promising directions .	some
Against the expectations of many , [MASK] unfolded peacefully in Madagascar , the Maldives and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , to name just a few places .	elections
[MASK] and the Republic of North Macedonia resolved their decades - long name dispute .	Greece
Political [MASK] in the Sudan and the peace process in the Central African Republic have brought renewed hope .	dialogue
My Special [MASK] just left Damascus after finalizing the last details with the Government and the opposition .	Envoy
The United [MASK] looks forward to convening the committee in Geneva in the coming weeks .	Nations
However , across the global landscape , [MASK] see conflicts persisting , terrorism spreading and the risk of a new arms race growing .	we
Outside [MASK] , often in violation of Security Council resolutions , make peace processes more difficult .	interferences
Many [MASK] remain unresolved , from Yemen and Libya to Afghanistan and beyond .	situations
A [MASK] of unilateral actions threatens to thwart a two - State solution between Israel and Palestine .	succession
In Venezuela , 4 million [MASK] have fled the country — one of the largest displacements in the world .	people
Above all , [MASK] are facing the alarming possibility of armed conflict in the Gulf , the consequences of which the world can not afford .	we
The recent [MASK] on Saudi Arabia ’s oil facilities was completely unacceptable .	attack
In a context where a minor miscalculation can lead to a major confrontation , [MASK] must do everything possible to push for reason and restraint .	we
[MASK] hope for a future in which all the countries of the region can live in a state of mutual respect and cooperation , without interference in each other ’s affairs .	I
[MASK] hope equally that it will still be possible to preserve the progress on nuclear non-proliferation represented by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action .	I
From the first day , [MASK] have emphasized prevention , mediation and a surge in diplomacy for peace in order to address the crises that we face .	I
Across some of the most troubled corners of the world , some 100,000 United Nations [MASK] protect civilians and promote peace .	peacekeepers
Through the Action for Peacekeeping initiative , [MASK] are strengthening our effectiveness and efficiency and we are renewing partnerships with troop - and police - contributing countries , host countries and regional organizations , such as the African Union and the European Union .	we
[MASK] am also proud of the work of our humanitarian workers , easing suffering around the world .	I
This year alone , in brutal attacks and other circumstances , [MASK] have lost at least 80 peacekeepers , humanitarian workers and others , all of whom gave their lives serving the United Nations and trying to better the lives of others .	we
[MASK] honour their service and their sacrifice .	I
[MASK] have bolstered our counter-terrorism architecture and defined new strategies to tackle violent extremism and to address root causes , while respecting human rights .	We
[MASK] have put forward a new disarmament agenda to advance global peace .	I
[MASK] must work to address the heightened threat posed by ballistic missiles and ensure a successful 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .	We
The [MASK] of the Korean peninsula remains uncertain .	situation
[MASK] fully support the efforts towards a new summit between the President of the United States and the leader of the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea .	I
[MASK] fear the possibility of a great fracture — the world splitting in two , with the two largest economies on Earth creating two separate and competing worlds , each with their own dominant currency , trade and financial rules , their own Internet and artificial intelligence capacities and their own zero - sum geopolitical and military strategies .	I
[MASK] must do everything possible to avert the great fracture and maintain a universal system — a universal economy with universal respect for international law , a multipolar world with strong multilateral institutions .	We
Mr. President , [MASK] need to catch my breath , so much has happened .	I
[MASK] have turned the page to a new chapter in the history of our democracy , and I am full of hope .	We
[MASK] would challenge anyone not to feel hopeful today after listening to Amanda Gorman , the amazing 22 – year - old poet , wise far beyond her years , who told us that :	I
Somehow [MASK] ’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that is n’t broken but simply unfinished	we
The [MASK] she spoke about — the strong and happy hope — the hope we feel today , is a hope , of course , that is tempered by reality .	hope
[MASK] was an inauguration unlike most others .	This
The [MASK] that customarily line the National Mall were absent , a reminder that our Nation is still in the throes of a deadly pandemic .	crowds
The [MASK] of thousands of National Guardsmen , police , and Secret Service was a reminder that 2 weeks ago , in this very room and on those very steps where President Biden took the oath , a mob of violent criminals tried to dismantle our democracy — our sacred democracy — brick by brick and would try again if they could .	presence
But , as President Biden said a few hours ago , today , [MASK] has prevailed , the will of the people was heeded , and the peaceful transfer of power fulfilled .	democracy
[MASK] Biden is now the 46th President of the United States .	Joe
[MASK] HARRIS is now the 49th Vice President of the United States .	KAMALA
But , of course , in more ways than one , [MASK] is not the 49th but the first — the first African - American woman , the first Asian - American woman , and the first woman , period , to hold the Office of Vice Presidency in our Nation ’s history .	she
Today , the [MASK] to our democracy from the Presidency itself has ended , but the challenges we face as a nation remain .	threat
In the wake of violence and division , hatred and mistruth , in the shadow of disease and economic hardship , a warming planet and unequal society , [MASK] begin the work of the 117th Congress .	we
In his inaugural address , [MASK] Biden spoke to this moment — a moment of great challenge — and told us two simple truths : One , that our responsibilities are numerous , and , two , it will take unity — unity of spirit , unity of purpose — to fulfill them .	President
President Biden , [MASK] heard you loud and clear .	we
[MASK] have a lengthy agenda , and we need to get it done together .	We
[MASK] Biden pointed the way to our Nation ’s recovery and renewal .	President
[MASK] reminded us of who we are and where we need to go , but we must now turn the spirit of his words into action .	He
The [MASK] must immediately set to work on the mission President Biden described — restoring the greatness and goodness of America .	Senate
[MASK] will be an exceptionally busy and consequential period for the U.S. Senate .	This
A few moments ago , the [MASK] welcomed three new Members to this Chamber .	Senate
[MASK] can now happily and proudly call them Senator PADILLA , Senator OSSOFF , and Senator WARNOCK .	I
[MASK] join Senators KELLY , HICKENLOOPER , and Luján as part of a six - Member class of Democratic Senators and a new Democratic Senate majority .	They
[MASK] mention the historic nature of Vice President HARRIS ’ ascendance , but let ’s not forget that her successor , ALEX PADILLA , is the first Latino Senator to represent California ; that RAFAEL WARNOCK , born while Georgia was represented in this Chamber by two staunch segregationists , is now the first African - American Senator Georgia has ever elected ; and that JOHN OSSOFF is the first Jewish Senator from his State , sworn in today on a book of Hebrew Scripture once owned by the rabbi , who , decades ago , formed a bond between the Jewish and African - American communities of Georgia .	I
With the swearing in of these three Senators , the [MASK] will turn to Democratic control , for which I deeply thank my colleagues .	Senate
[MASK] will return to Democratic control under the first New York - born majority leader in American history — a kid from Brooklyn , the son of an exterminator and a housewife , and a descendant of victims of the Holocaust .	We
Today , [MASK] feel the full weight of that responsibility , a sense of reverence and of awe at the trust placed in me .	I
[MASK] intend to honor that trust with all of my energy and with joy .	I
And as the majority changes in the Senate , the [MASK] will do business differently .	Senate
The [MASK] will address the challenges our country faces head on and without delay , not with timid solutions but with boldness and with courage .	Senate
The [MASK] will tackle the perils of the moment , a once - in - a - generation health and economic crisis , and it will strive to make progress on generations - long struggle for racial justice , economic justice , equality of opportunity , and equality under the law .	Senate
This [MASK] will legislate .	Senate
[MASK] will be active , responsive , energetic , and bold .	It
And to my Republican colleagues , when and where we can , the Democratic [MASK] will strive to make this important work bipartisan .	majority
The [MASK] works best when we work together .	Senate
[MASK] have no choice .	We
The [MASK] we face are great .	challenges
The [MASK] in the country are real .	divisions
[MASK] have no choice but to try to work together every day to reward the faith the American people have placed in us .	We
[MASK] yield the floor .	I
[MASK] is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office , where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this Nation .	This
Each time [MASK] have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the national interest .	I
In all the decisions I have made in my public life , [MASK] have always tried to do what was best for the Nation .	I
Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate , [MASK] have felt it was my duty to persevere , to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me .	I
As long as there was such a base , [MASK] felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion , that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future .	I
But with the disappearance of that base , [MASK] now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served , and there is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged .	I
[MASK] would have preferred to carry through to the finish , whatever the personal agony it would have involved , and my family unanimously urged me to do so .	I
But the [MASK] of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations .	interests
From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders , [MASK] have concluded that because of the Watergate matter , I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation will require .	I
[MASK] have never been a quitter .	I
But as President , [MASK] must put the interests of America first .	I
[MASK] needs a full - time President and a full - time Congress , particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad .	America
Therefore , [MASK] shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow .	I
As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term , [MASK] feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next 2 1/2 years .	I
But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President Ford , [MASK] know , as I told the Nation when I nominated him for that office 10 months ago , that the leadership of America will be in good hands .	I
In passing this office to the Vice President , [MASK] also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow and , therefore , of the understanding , the patience , the cooperation he will need from all Americans .	I
As he assumes that responsibility , [MASK] will deserve the help and the support of all of us .	he
By taking this action , [MASK] hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America .	I
[MASK] regret deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision .	I
[MASK] would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong -- and some were wrong -- they were made in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the Nation .	I
To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months -- to my family , my friends , to many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right -- [MASK] will be eternally grateful for your support .	I
[MASK] shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term , but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the past 5 1/2 years .	I
These [MASK] have been a momentous time in the history of our Nation and the world .	years
[MASK] have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud , achievements that represent the shared efforts of the Administration , the Congress , and the people .	They
But the [MASK] ahead are equally great , and they , too , will require the support and the efforts of the Congress and the people working in cooperation with the new Administration .	challenges
[MASK] have ended America 's longest war , but in the work of securing a lasting peace in the world , the goals ahead are even more far - reaching and more difficult .	We
[MASK] must complete a structure of peace so that it will be said of this generation , our generation of Americans , by the people of all nations , not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars .	We
[MASK] have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States and the People 's Republic of China .	We
[MASK] must now ensure that the one quarter of the world 's people who live in the People 's Republic of China will be and remain not our enemies , but our friends .	We
[MASK] am proud to come here to Philadelphia and join my fellow Democrats .	I
In 1960 , the [MASK] of this city produced a margin in the presidential race that was in this city three times as large as it was in the whole United States .	Democrats
So [MASK] am proud to be back here again , and I am very happy to be introduced by your distinguished chairman , Bill Green .	I
[MASK] can understand why some Republicans may not like it , but , as a Democrat , as one who believes in the Democratic Party , as one who believes that the Democratic Party has meant progress for this city , this State , and this country , I am proud to be here in Philadelphia .	I
And [MASK] am proud to be here with your mayor .	I
[MASK] do not come from Philadelphia , and I would not interfere , but I am hopeful and confident that when we come to the Army - Navy game in a month from now , we will be greeted by the new mayor of Philadelphia , Mayor Tale .	I
[MASK] have n't given a political speech for about 3 years , so I am a little out of practice , but I am gradually getting back into it .	I
And [MASK] am glad to be here with a mayor who follows two other distinguished mayors of this city , who carries on their tradition - Joe Clark , your United States Senator who was a great mayor of Philadelphia , and Dick Dilworth , who followed him , who was a great mayor of Philadelphia .	I
[MASK] is the tradition of honest , progressive democratic government that Mayor Tate carries on .	That
And [MASK] am glad to be here with Judge Hoffman and Senator Mahady who also run this fall in the State of Pennsylvania .	I
[MASK] expects things of Presidents , but I am not sure that they realize how much depends upon the Members of the House and the Members of the Senate who must make the final judgment on what kind of laws a President must execute .	Everyone
The [MASK] from this city as well as the Senator from this State - Bill Barrett and Bob Nix and Herman Toll and Jim Byrne and Chairman Green - have , with Joe Clark supported legislation month in and month out that benefited this city and this State and this country and , what is more , has helped make the United States meet its responsibilities around the globe .	Congressmen
And [MASK] am also proud to be here with your former Governor who is now working for us in Washington as our adviser on fair housing , Governor Dave Lawrence , of the State of Pennsylvania .	I
Three years ago tomorrow night , [MASK] spoke in this hall in the closing days of the 1960 campaign , and I asked the people of this city to give us their support to help this country move again .	I
The [MASK] of Philadelphia gave that support , and the support I received from this city and this State was , as it was in the 1960 convention , the key to our victory across the country .	people
[MASK] am back in Philadelphia to express my thanks for that support and also to express appreciation for the help we received from those Democrats in this city and State , and to report to you on the progress that this country has made on the goals that were outlined 3 years ago .	I
[MASK] did not promise on that October night that life would be easy in the Great Republic .	I
[MASK] did not say we would not have new pressures and new problems .	I
Nor did [MASK] speak of swift solutions in 100 days in office .	I
[MASK] talked instead about the kind of America that I wanted for my family and for your family and all those who are citizens of this country in these difficult and changing years , the kind of America in which I believed , not as a Democrat or as a candidate , but as a citizen .	I
Today , in many ways , the [MASK] looks very different , and the revolutionary change of pace is even more rapid than it has been in the past .	world
[MASK] still believe in the kind of America which I described in this hall 3 years ago , and I am still determined that this Nation shall continue to strive to meet those goals .	I
And [MASK] am gratified to be able to report some progress in the last 33 1/2 months .	I
[MASK] said , first of all , that I believed in America where work was available to those who were willing and able to work , where the waste of idle men and machines could be avoided , and where greater economic growth could provide the new jobs and the new markets that our growing Nation needed .	I
And our high wartime tax [MASK] still prevent our economy from growing as fully and as freely as it must .	rates
But one fact is that 2 1/2 million [MASK] more are working in the United States than were working 33 months ago .	people
And if we can obtain the early passage of an effective tax cut which the House of Representatives has already passed -- and which the Ways and Means Committee , on which Bill Green serves , wrote -- [MASK] shall be sailing this country next year on the longest and strongest peacetime expansion of our economy in the history of the United States .	we
[MASK] is well within our reach .	It
[MASK] would like to begin by sincerely thanking Creative Commons Africa community and under the able coordination of Alex Gakuru and Tobias Schonwetter , and the global Creative Commons Community for inviting me to preside over this launch .	I
[MASK] am happy to note the enthusiasm demonstrated by School of Open Africa in transforming education along Sustainable Development Goals proposed for post - 2015 ( Goal No. 4 : “ Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life - long learning opportunities for all ” ) and in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 which seeks to transform Kenya into a middle - income country that offers high quality of life to all citizens by the year 2030 .

I
[MASK] are now in the second medium term plan cycle ( 2013 - 2017 ) whose theme is “ Transforming Kenya : Pathways to Devolution , Socio-economic Development , Equity and National Unity ” .	We

Again , the Master [MASK] , with the flagship projects to pilot its implementation , will steer the march towards the digital future that will transform the country to a regional technical hub , raise the country ’s competitiveness and align the country in line with vision 2030 ’s ICT goals .	plan
By launching the Kenya ICT Master Plan , the [MASK] revealed its commitment towards the enhancement of access to quality education and training through ICT in line with the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) .	government

[MASK] provides a platform that enables the realization of these goals .	ICT
[MASK] must emphasize that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan .	I
The [MASK] of ICT into educational programmes places both the teaching staff and students at the forefront in the utilization of ICT for the enhancement of lives .	integration
[MASK] note with great pleasure the freedom to re-purpose offered by openly licensed educational resources , the convenience online access to learners as alternative courses delivery and certification methods .	I
At this juncture , ladies and gentlemen , [MASK] thank William Fisher III , Professor of Intellectual Property and his staff at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School for providing a free copyright law course taught to graduands present today to receive their certificates .	I
[MASK] also thank Michael Murungi ( then CEO , National Council for Law Reporting or “ Kenya Law ” ) and Alex Gakuru for successfully conducting the course in Nairobi .	I
[MASK] must congratulate the former students and ask to make the very best use of the copyright law knowledge they acquired while also challenging all universities represented here to consider emulating the highly successfully CopyrightX initiative .	I
As the government continues to work on modalities of ensuring universal access to education and increasing the internet penetration in all parts of the country , [MASK] are pleased to witness this mode of study that will definitely translate to affordable education .	we
Open Education [MASK] coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge - based economy .	Resources
By using Open Educational Resources , OER , [MASK] of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education , especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education .	School
Ongoing , voluntary , and self - motivated [MASK] of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century .	pursuit
[MASK] of the major ways of promoting life - long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education .	One

[MASK] am very honored to be with you all .	I
[MASK] Joe Biden and I talk often about our mutual passion for everything you all do .	President
[MASK] is a very exciting moment to join you for the unveiling of the work that you have been laboring on for decades .	This
So , yes , as Chair of the National Space Council , [MASK] know that today represents an exciting new chapter in the exploration of our universe .	I
From the beginning of history , [MASK] have looked up to the night sky with wonder .	humans
And thanks to dedicated people who have been working for decades in engineering and on scientific marvels , [MASK] can look to the sky with new understanding .	we
When NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 , [MASK] were able to see the stars unobstructed by the Earth ’s atmosphere and understand the universe in ways we could have never imagined even a few decades earlier .	we
And now [MASK] enter a new phase of scientific discovery .	we
Building on the legacy of Hubble , the James Webb Space [MASK] allows us to see deeper into space than ever before and in stunning clarity .	Telescope
[MASK] will enhance what we know about the origins of our universe , our solar system , and possibly life itself .	It
And [MASK] is an example of how the scientific endeavor can build upon the international rules and norms that govern our cooperation in space .	it
This [MASK] is one of humanity ’s great engineering achievements .	telescope
And the [MASK] we will see today are a testament to the amazing work done by the thousands of workers across our nation who dedicated years to this project .	images
[MASK] embarked on this complex endeavor for the benefit of humankind , and in the process , accelerated American innovation , strengthened partnerships with our allies , and will undoubtedly inspire generations to look to the heavens with excitement and ambition .	They
And [MASK] was going to say “ good afternoon , ” but we ’re starting this meeting late because I was engaged in preparing for a trip to the Middle East .	I
But [MASK] is a historic day .	today
Bill , [MASK] ’re a good friend .	you
And — and , Dr. Nelson , [MASK] ’re doing a great job leading this Office of Science and Technology Policy .	you
It really is a matter — [MASK] really is amazing .	it
Six and a half months ago , a [MASK] launched from Earth carrying the world ’s newest , most powerful deep - space telescope on a journey one million miles into the cosmos — first of all , that blows my mind : a million miles into the cosmos — along the way unfolding itself , deploying a mirror 21 feet wide , a sunshield the size of a tennis court , and 250,000 tiny shutters , each one smaller than a grain of sand .	rocket
Put together , [MASK] ’s a new window into the history of our universe .	it
And today , [MASK] ’re going to get a glimpse of the first light to shine through that window — light from other worlds , orbiting stars far beyond our own .	we
[MASK] ’s astounding to me when I read this and saw the — I mean , it really is .	It
It ’s — it ’s — anyway , I do n’t want to — [MASK] ’ll see what they think when we see this .	I
[MASK] ’s hard to even fathom .	It
Tomorrow , when this image is shared with the world , [MASK] will be a historic moment for science and technology , for astronomy and space exploration , for America and all of humanity .	it

Many [MASK] who migrated to Texas at the invitation of the Mexican government did not completely shed their identity or loyalty to the United States .	Americans
[MASK] brought American traditions and expectations with them ( including , for many , the right to own slaves ) .	They
For instance , the [MASK] of these new settlers were Protestant , and though they were not required to attend the Catholic mass , Mexico 's prohibition on the public practice of other religions upset them and they routinely ignored it .	majority
Accustomed to representative democracy , jury trials , and the defendant ’s right to appear before a judge , the Anglo - American [MASK] in Texas also disliked the Mexican legal system , which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde , an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor , judge , and law enforcement officer .	settlers
The [MASK] sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in Saltillo , the state capital , who decided the outcome .	alcalde
[MASK] also resented that at most two Texas representatives were allowed in the state legislature .	Settlers
Their greatest [MASK] of discontent , though , was the Mexican government 's 1829 abolition of slavery .	source
Most American [MASK] were from southern states , and many had brought slaves with them .	settlers

But American [MASK] in Texas distrusted the Mexican government and wanted Texas to be a new U.S. slave state .	slaveholders

Fifty - five [MASK] from the Anglo - American settlements gathered in 1831 to demand the suspension of customs duties , the resumption of immigration from the United States , better protection from Indian tribes , the granting of promised land titles , and the creation of an independent state of Texas separate from Coahuila .	delegates

A [MASK] comes to class one day , and the instructor says , “ I ’ve decided that you ’re all a bunch of failures and I ’m flunking the entire class . ”	student
The [MASK] announces , “ I ’ve decided that you ’re all a bunch of failures and I ’m flunking the entire class . ”	instructor
Then , as the class erupts in protest , the [MASK] calmly blinks one eye , leaving the other eye open .	instructor
Would [MASK] take this woman seriously ?	you
[MASK] just happened there ?	What
[MASK] blink to keep eyes hydrated and clear of debris .	Humans
On average , [MASK] blink 15 to 20 times every minute .	humans
Without realizing it , [MASK] are necessarily blinking throughout every conversation , every social interaction , every activity during the day .	people
The [MASK] we talk to and interact with are also blinking constantly , so often that everyone is accustomed to ignoring it .	people
But if someone deliberately blinks one eye , leaving the other one open , [MASK] ’s a completely different matter .	that
In American culture ( and many others ) , a [MASK] often indicates that someone is joking around and that whatever they ’ve just said or done should not be taken seriously .	wink
Of course , a [MASK] can mean different things in different societies .	wink
Moreover , a [MASK] can mean different things in the same society .	wink
If someone on a date takes their companion ’s hand and gives a cute little wink , the [MASK] may have reason to hope the winker is not just joking around .	person
American cultural [MASK] Clifford Geertz ( 1973 ) used the example of winking to illustrate two important aspects of culture .	anthropologist
Innate human [MASK] — that is , behaviors that people are born with — are biological , not cultural .	behaviors
Acquired human [MASK] — that is , behaviors that people are taught — are cultural .	behaviors
[MASK] means that cultural behaviors are not genetically inherited from generation to generation but must be passed down from older members of a society to younger members .	This
Some [MASK] of enculturation are deliberate and systematic , such as learning the rules of written punctuation in a language .	aspects
At some point in an English speaker ’s childhood , [MASK] explicitly told them the difference between a question mark and an exclamation point .	someone
Most likely , [MASK] learned this distinction in school , a fundamental institution of enculturation in many societies .	they
Religious [MASK] are another common force of enculturation , providing explicit instruction in cultural rules of morality and social interaction .	institutions
Extracurricular [MASK] such as sports , dance , and music lessons also teach children cultural rules and norms .	activities
By virtue of growing up in a culture , [MASK] learn what certain actions and objects mean , how their society operates , and what the rules are for appropriate behavior .	children
Going back to the cultural notion of home , did [MASK] ever explain to you why your childhood home was structured in a certain way ?	anyone
Did [MASK] ever point out the cultural assumptions about gender and family built into your house ?	anyone
Living in that house , [MASK] would have wordlessly absorbed a set of assumptions about family , gender , work , leisure , hospitality , and property .	you
And [MASK] of it would seem quite natural to you .	all
Perhaps when you were a child , [MASK] told you what a wink was and showed you how to accomplish one ; or perhaps you just witnessed a few winks , figured out what they meant from their contexts , and then learned how to accomplish one through trial and error .	someone
[MASK] pointed out that there are two important aspects to winking : the meaning and the action .	Geertz
As both are learned , [MASK] are cultural .	both
A relevant question to our concern might be , would this artistic [MASK] in the Chinese tradition be the same as beauty ?	excellence
If we browse Chinese classical writings on art criticism , a striking [MASK] manifests — there the category of mei or beauty does not have a dominant presence .	difference
Moreover , according to Xu Hong ’s ( c. 1580 – 1660 ) Xishan Qinkuang 谿山 琴况 ( c. 1640 ) , the most influential treatise on the aesthetics of guqin ( Chinese zither ) music , the [MASK] of li ( pretty , beautiful ) is merely the 10th of the 24 aesthetic categories , and the top six were harmony , tranquillity , clarity , profundity , antiquity , subtlety . [ 38 ]	category
Overall , [MASK] also finds that the comparison between the beautiful and the sublime — which defined the influential aesthetics of Edmund Burke ( 1729 – 1797 ) and Immanuel Kant , and consequently became an iconic discourse in Western aesthetics — is also missing in the Chinese history of aesthetics .	one
The Hegelian [MASK] of aesthetics as the philosophy of art that considers the issue of artistic beauty as its core concern is no more enchanting in our time .	definition
[MASK] would agree that the question “ what makes an artwork beautiful ” plays a minor role in contemporary aesthetics and philosophy of art , where the question has been updated to “ what makes an artwork meaningful or valuable ? ”	Many
Two [MASK] might contribute to this situation .	factors
Also , when the representationalism , the expression theories , formalism , neoformalism , aesthetic theories in defining art all fail to offer an account that is capable of coping with the dynamic scenes of the artworld , and when the anti-essentialist movement in philosophical aesthetics then paves a way to functionalism , institutionalism and various versions of historicism , the [MASK] of artistic beauty as such not only loses its limelight , but also is , to some extent , abandoned for its strong Hegelian colour .	question
Secondly , the [MASK] into “ beauty ” experienced a shift of focus from the emphasis on aesthetic properties of the objects to the subjective experience involved in aesthetic appreciation .	inquiry
[MASK] regards artistic beauty as a property of artworks which is independent of the subject , while non-realism holds that artistic beauty is not an independent property of artworks .	Realism
This [MASK] has a long historical preparation , contributed especially by the British empiricists such as Francis Hutcheson ( 1694 – 1746 ) and David Hume ( 1711 – 1776 ) .	shift
[MASK] thinks that beauty lies in both the object and the subject , and artistic beauty comes from the quality of “ uniformity amidst variety ” in the object and the involvement of an “ internal sense ” in the subject . [ 39 ]	Hutcheson
[MASK] argues that “ beauty is no quality in things themselves , ” but a “ sentiment ” in “ the mind that contemplates them ” and “ to seek the real beauty … is … fruitless . ” [ 40 ]	Hume
In contemporary aesthetics , from the study of empathy to Freud ’s libido , to the evolutionary theory of beauty , to the focus on perception in aesthetic experience , more and more [MASK] seek to answer the question of what makes an artwork beautiful in light of human physiology and psychology .	philosophers
For instance , the evolutionary [MASK] regards artistic beauty as “ fitness signal ” that displays desirable personal qualities that strengthen reproductive advantage , and our pleasant feeling caused by something beautiful , like sexual pleasure , is engraved in our minds by the process of evolution , assisting us to make the “ the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction . ” [ 41 ]	theory
39. “ The [MASK] which excite in us the Ideas of Beauty , seem to be those in which there is Uniformity amidst Variety ” ( § II , p. 28 ) .	Figures
“ The internal [MASK] is , a passive Power of receiving Ideas of Beauty from all Objects in which there is Uniformity amidst Variety ” ( § VI , 67 ) .	Sense
40. “ [MASK] is no quality in things themselves : it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them ; and each mind perceives a different beauty … every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment , without pretending to regulate those of others .	Beauty

By the end of this section , [MASK] will be able to :	you
The [MASK] is endlessly perceiving , processing , planning , organizing , and remembering — it is always active .	brain
Yet , [MASK] do n’t notice most of your brain ’s activity as you move throughout your daily routine .	you
[MASK] is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .	This
Simply put , [MASK] is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .	cognition
[MASK] who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .	Scientists
Upon waking each morning , [MASK] begin thinking — contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day .	you
In what order should [MASK] run your errands ?	you
Should [MASK] go to the bank , the cleaners , or the grocery store first ?	you
Can [MASK] get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done ?	you
These [MASK] are one example of cognition at work .	thoughts
Exceptionally complex , [MASK] is an essential feature of human consciousness , yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced .	cognition
Cognitive [MASK] is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think .	psychology
[MASK] attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .	It
Cognitive [MASK] strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence , why some people are better at problem solving than others , and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace , among countless other topics .	psychologists
[MASK] also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information gathered from our environments into meaningful categories of thought , which will be discussed later .	They
The human nervous [MASK] is capable of handling endless streams of information .	system
The [MASK] serve as the interface between the mind and the external environment , receiving stimuli and translating it into nervous impulses that are transmitted to the brain .	senses
The [MASK] then processes this information and uses the relevant pieces to create thoughts , which can then be expressed through language or stored in memory for future use .	brain
To make this process more complex , the [MASK] does not gather information from external environments only .	brain
When thoughts are formed , the [MASK] also pulls information from emotions and memories ( Figure 7.2 ) .	brain
[MASK] and memory are powerful influences on both our thoughts and behaviors .	Emotion
In order to organize this staggering amount of information , the [MASK] has developed a file cabinet of sorts in the mind .	brain
[MASK] are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .	Concepts
[MASK] are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .	Concepts
[MASK] use concepts to see the relationships among the different elements of your experiences and to keep the information in your mind organized and accessible .	You
When you study United States history , for example , [MASK] learn about more than just individual events that have happened in America ’s past .	you
[MASK] absorb a large quantity of information by listening to and participating in discussions , examining maps , and reading first - hand accounts of people ’s lives .	You
Your [MASK] analyzes these details and develops an overall understanding of American history .	brain
In the process , your [MASK] gathers details that inform and refine your understanding of related concepts like democracy , power , and freedom .	brain
[MASK] can be complex and abstract , like justice , or more concrete , like types of birds .	Concepts
In psychology , for example , Piaget ’s [MASK] of development are abstract concepts .	stages
Other [MASK] , like the characteristics of your ideal friend or your family ’s birthday traditions , are personal and individualized .	concepts
In this way , [MASK] touch every aspect of our lives , from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behind the way governments function .	concepts
Another [MASK] used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .	technique
A [MASK] is the best example or representation of a concept .	prototype
For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your [MASK] could be Rosa Parks .	prototype
Her peaceful [MASK] to segregation on a city bus in Montgomery , Alabama , is a recognizable example of civil disobedience .	resistance
Or your [MASK] could be Mohandas Gandhi , sometimes called Mahatma Gandhi ( “ Mahatma ” is an honorific title ) ( Figure 7.3 ) .	prototype
In 1930 , [MASK] Gandhi led a group in peaceful protest against a British tax on salt in India .	Mohandas
[MASK] Gandhi served as a nonviolent force for independence for India while simultaneously demanding that Buddhist , Hindu , Muslim , and Christian leaders — both Indian and British — collaborate peacefully .	Mohandas
Although he was not always successful in preventing violence around him , his [MASK] provides a steadfast example of the civil disobedience prototype ( Constitutional Rights Foundation , 2013 ) .	life
Just as concepts can be abstract or concrete , [MASK] can make a distinction between concepts that are functions of our direct experience with the world and those that are more artificial in nature .	we
Within your industry of interest or area of study , [MASK] are the challenges that create frustration ?	what
Earlier in this chapter , [MASK] discussed Evernote , a company that focuses on expanding our memories by storing and organizing information .	we
In the agriculture industry , [MASK] , weeds , weather conditions , and the challenges of harvesting crops are all ripe for entrepreneurial activities .	insects
The [MASK] toward organic produce has also affected this industry .	move
From an entrepreneurial perspective , what products could [MASK] invent to support both organic farming and the problems of insects that damage or destroy crops ?	you
One new [MASK] to solve this problem combines a vacuum cleaner with an agriculture product .	idea
A bug [MASK] is an example of how using divergent thinking contributed to the solution of removing bugs from crops without using chemicals .	vacuum
However , in the incubation stage , the [MASK] must have come forward as a viable solution .	idea
[MASK] frequently face the challenge of pressure to conform to established habits and patterns within industries .	Entrepreneurs
Often , the entrepreneurial [MASK] includes futuristic ideas that shake up the normal , conventional processes that are grounded in experience over time .	mindset
Tried - and - tested [MASK] and products that have a proven history of success can be a formidable obstacle to new ideas .	processes
A new [MASK] may even appear as impossible or outlandish , perhaps even an embarrassment to the steady and predictable practices established within an industry .	idea
[MASK] can create a dilemma : Do we try something new and unproven that lacks documented research ?	This
Sometimes , [MASK] must disregard our past successes and research to be open to new possibilities for success and failure .	we
An entrepreneurial [MASK] includes creativity , problem - solving skills , and a propensity to innovation . 23	mindset
Open - [MASK] is one characteristic that supports creativity , problem solving , and innovation .	mindedness
Some [MASK] can lead to disruptions within the industry , or even create a new industry .	innovations
One [MASK] of a disruptive technology is Airbnb , a company that threatens the established hotel industry by connecting personal resources to people who desire those resources .	example
[MASK] has become a significant threat to the established hotel industry ’s business model of building large hotels and renting rooms within those hotels to their customers .	Airbnb
[MASK] has reconfigured that model , and since its 2008 launch , 150 million travelers have taken advantage of 3 million Airbnb listings in more than 191 countries .	Airbnb
[MASK] has raised more than $ 3 billion ( plus a $ 1 billion credit line ) and is considering selling stocks to support significant expansion .	Airbnb
The [MASK] of Airbnb is approximately $ 30 billion .	value
The hotel [MASK] recognized Airbnb as a threat , and in 2016 , began a campaign to create legislation to rein in Airbnb ’s growth and popularity .	industry
From the hotel industry ’s perspective , [MASK] is not playing by the same rules .	Airbnb
[MASK] is the definition of disruptive technology , the focus on creating a new idea or process that negates or challenges established process or products . 24	This
Sometimes disruptive [MASK] result from not listening to customers .	technologies
[MASK] do n’t always know what they want .	Customers
Customer [MASK] might need to be redefined by the entrepreneurial team on the basis of better models , knowing when to invest in developing lower - performance products that promise lower margins while still satisfying the need , and knowing when to pursue small markets at the expense of larger or established markets .	groups
Basically , disruptive [MASK] occur through identifying new and valuable processes and products .	technologies
The [MASK] of Airbnb recognized that some people have unused resources , bedrooms , that other people need .	founders
[MASK] can apply this idea to other unused resources such as vehicles and motor homes .	We
[MASK] see this model reproduced in short - term car rental and bike - sharing programs .	We
So far , [MASK] have covered how evolutionary ethics relates to the question what we ought to do and why we are moral in the first place .	we
A related [MASK] of questions about ethics are metaethical questions , which concern the meaning of moral terms , our ways of gaining knowledge of moral facts , and the nature of the moral facts .	set
In other words , apart from thinking about how we ought to live , and where our moral sense comes from , [MASK] can also ask what it means to affirm a particular answer to that question , how we could come to know the answer , and whether the answer would be a matter of fact or more like an opinion .	we
Many [MASK] and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation that moral judgments seem to be objectively true and the assumption that this is how non-philosophers also think about morality .	books
For example , [MASK] Smith writes :	Michael
[MASK] seem to think moral questions have correct answers ; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts ; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances ; and that , by engaging in moral conversation and argument , we can discover what these objective facts are .	We
But as we have seen above , evolutionary [MASK] explains why we would think that moral judgments are objective .	theory
The [MASK] Michael Ruse takes this to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “ illusion ” foisted on us by our genes ( Ruse [ 1986 ] 1998 , 253 ) .	philosopher
Of course , even if Ruse is correct , [MASK] does not show that moral judgments are not objective , but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained , as many philosophers assume .	this
[MASK] has also argued that an evolutionary account of morality suggests that there are no moral facts in the first place .	Ruse
If moral facts are explanatorily redundant , indeed , moral [MASK] ( those who believe there are mind - independent , objective facts about morality , as discussed in Chapter 1 ) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist .	realists
Interestingly , Ruse ’s methodological [MASK] leads him to embrace a view that goes against the metaphysical naturalist position that moral facts exist .	naturalism
Relatedly , [MASK] Street , for example , argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false .	Sharon
The [MASK] of moral realism that Street has in mind is the view that moral properties exist as objective features of the world ( to wit , whether stealing is wrong is independent of whether anyone thinks or feels that stealing is wrong ) .	kind
[MASK] starts with the premise that our moral judgments are influenced by evolutionary forces .	Street
This [MASK] , Street claims , gives rise to a dilemma for moral realists concerning the relation of the evolutionary forces that influenced our moral judgments and the moral facts claimed to exist by moral realists .	fact
If there is no relation between the evolutionary forces and the moral facts , then [MASK] would be an astonishing coincidence if many of our moral judgments were true .	it
In light of the coincidence , [MASK] have no reason to assume that our moral judgments are true — an unpalatable conclusion for realists .	we
So , [MASK] should reject moral realism .	we
Street ’s [MASK] illustrates how evolutionary theory can be used to make a case about which metaethical theories we should adopt .	argument
Both Ruse ’s and Street ’s [MASK] rely on the idea that we should only accept that something exists if it plays an indispensable explanatory role and there are means to resist these arguments . [ 12 ]	arguments
Both [MASK] , as presented here , rely on the correctness of the evolutionary explanation of morality they convey .	arguments
In the next section , [MASK] turn to the relevance of evolutionary ethics for moral epistemology .	we
Can [MASK] have Justified Moral Beliefs ?	We
[MASK] would seem like an incredible coincidence if the realists were right that our moral judgments are nonetheless true .	It
[MASK] claims that such a coincidence would be too much to believe .	Street
But [MASK] is the problem , exactly , with having beliefs that are only coincidentally true ?	what
Depending on how we understand “ coincidence , ” my [MASK] that there is a bird outside my window is coincidentally true because had I looked a little later , the bird would have flown away already .	belief
Accidentally true [MASK] do not seem problematic in every case .	beliefs
The [MASK] Richard Joyce argues that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts ( Joyce 2006 ) .	philosopher
Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces , and not by the moral facts , our moral [MASK] would be the same even if the moral facts would change .	beliefs
But because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs , evolutionary [MASK] of morality show that our moral beliefs are unjustified ( because they are not sensitive ) .	explanations
[MASK] is not clear , however , whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective .	It
The [MASK] of evolutionary ethics on epistemological questions depends on these deeper questions about epistemology . [ 13 ]	impact
Evolutionary [MASK] of morality , however , provide us with a useful starting point for thinking about these questions .	explanations
Evolutionary [MASK] has helped us to get a much clearer sense of where the human moral sense is coming from .	ethics
While this is a far cry from revealing to us what we ought to do , the research [MASK] seems full of promise nonetheless .	program
Once we get into the details , [MASK] can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations , the relation of descriptive and normative claims , the epistemology of justification and truth , and the general viability of naturalism in ethics .	we
[MASK] left to wonder , then , but with some ideas about where to get our answers .	Much
How do different [MASK] of motivation affect my learning ?	types
How can [MASK] apply the Uses and Gratification Theory to make decisions about my learning ?	I
How do [MASK] prevent negative bias from hindering learning ?	I
In this section , [MASK] will continue to increase your ability as an informed learner .	you
Here [MASK] will explore how much of an influence motivation has on learning , as well as how to use motivation to purposefully take an active role in any learning activity .	you
Rather than passively attempting to absorb new information , [MASK] will learn how to make conscious decisions about the methods of learning you will use ( based on what you intend to do with the information ) , how you will select and use learning materials that are appropriate for your needs , and how persistent you will be in the learning activity .	you
[MASK] will find that each of these is a strong tool that will enable you to engage with learning material in a way that not only suits your needs , but also gives you ownership over your own learning processes .	You
While much of this chapter will cover very specific aspects about the act of learning , in this section , [MASK] will present different information that may at first seem unrelated .	we
Some [MASK] would consider it more of a personal outlook than a learning practice , and yet it has a significant influence on the ability to learn .	people
U.S. Army [MASK] and captain of the U.S. Invictus team , Will Reynolds , races to the finish line .	veteran
The [MASK] showed that grit and perseverance were better predictors of academic success and achievement than talent or IQ .	study
In a 2007 study [MASK] and colleagues found that individuals with high grit were able to maintain motivation in learning tasks despite failures .	Duckworth
The [MASK] examined a cross section of learning environments , such as GPA scores in Ivy League universities , dropout rates at West Point , rankings in the National Spelling Bee , and general educational attainment for adults .	study
What the results showed was that [MASK] and perseverance were better predictors of academic success and achievement than talent or IQ .	grit
The [MASK] of grit is an easy one to dismiss as something taken for granted .	concept
In our culture , [MASK] have a number of sayings and aphorisms that capture the essence of grit : “ If at first you do not succeed , try , try again , ” or the famous quote by Thomas Edison : “ Genius is one percent inspiration , ninety - nine percent perspiration . ”	we
The problem is [MASK] all understand the concept , but actually applying it takes work .	we
If the task we are trying to complete is a difficult one , [MASK] can take a lot of work .	it
In your first attempt at studying [MASK] simply reread the chapters of your textbook covered in the exam .	you
[MASK] find that while this reinforces some of the knowledge you have gained , it does not ensure you have all the information you will need to do well on the test .	You
[MASK] know that if you simply read the chapters yet again , there is no guarantee you are going to be any more successful .	You
[MASK] determine that you need to find a different approach .	You
In other words , your first [MASK] was not a complete failure , but it did not achieve the end goal , so you try again with a different method .	attempt
On your second try , [MASK] copy down all of the main points onto a piece of paper using the section headlines from the chapters .	you
After a short break [MASK] come back to your list and write down a summary of what you know about each item on your list .	you
[MASK] accomplishes two things : first , you are able to immediately spot areas where you need to learn more , and second , you can check your summaries against the text to make certain what you know is correct and adequate .	This
In this example , while you may not have yet achieved complete success , [MASK] will have learned what you need to do next .	you
In true grit fashion , for your next try , [MASK] study those items on your list where you found you needed a bit more information , and then you go through your list again .	you
This time [MASK] are able to write down summaries of all the important points , and you are confident you have the knowledge you need to do well on the exam .	you
After this , [MASK] still do not stop , but instead you change your approach to use other methods that keep what you have learned fresh in your mind .	you
By the end of this section , [MASK] will be able to :	you
Some [MASK] believe that between nine and fifteen thousand years ago , a land bridge existed between Asia and North America that we now call Beringia .	scholars
The first [MASK] of what would be named the Americas migrated across this bridge in search of food .	inhabitants
When the glaciers melted , [MASK] engulfed Beringia , and the Bering Strait was formed .	water
Later [MASK] came by boat across the narrow strait .	settlers
( The [MASK] that Asians and American Indians share genetic markers on a Y chromosome lends credibility to this migration theory . )	fact
Continually moving southward , the [MASK] eventually populated both North and South America , creating unique cultures that ranged from the highly complex and urban Aztec civilization in what is now Mexico City to the woodland tribes of eastern North America .	settlers
Recent [MASK] along the west coast of South America suggests that migrant populations may have traveled down this coast by water as well as by land .	research
[MASK] believe that about ten thousand years ago , humans also began the domestication of plants and animals , adding agriculture as a means of sustenance to hunting and gathering techniques .	Researchers
With this agricultural revolution , and the more abundant and reliable food supplies it brought , [MASK] grew and people were able to develop a more settled way of life , building permanent settlements .	populations
Nowhere in the Americas was [MASK] more obvious than in Mesoamerica ( Figure 1.3 ) .	this
This [MASK] shows the extent of the major civilizations of the Western Hemisphere .	map
In South America , early [MASK] developed along the coast because the high Andes and the inhospitable Amazon Basin made the interior of the continent less favorable for settlement .	civilizations
[MASK] is the geographic area stretching from north of Panama up to the desert of central Mexico .	Mesoamerica
Although marked by great topographic , linguistic , and cultural diversity , this [MASK] cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics .	region
[MASK] were polytheistic ; their gods possessed both male and female traits and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies taken in battle or ritual bloodletting .	Mesoamericans
[MASK] , or maize , domesticated by 5000 BCE , formed the basis of their diet .	Corn
[MASK] developed a mathematical system , built huge edifices , and devised a calendar that accurately predicted eclipses and solstices and that priest - astronomers used to direct the planting and harvesting of crops .	They
Most important for our knowledge of these peoples , [MASK] created the only known written language in the Western Hemisphere ; researchers have made much progress in interpreting the inscriptions on their temples and pyramids .	they
Though the area had no overarching political structure , [MASK] over long distances helped diffuse culture .	trade
[MASK] made of obsidian , jewelry crafted from jade , feathers woven into clothing and ornaments , and cacao beans that were whipped into a chocolate drink formed the basis of commerce .	Weapons
The [MASK] of Mesoamerican cultures was the Olmec civilization .	mother
Flourishing along the hot Gulf Coast of Mexico from about 1200 to about 400 BCE , the [MASK] produced a number of major works of art , architecture , pottery , and sculpture .	Olmec
The [MASK] built aqueducts to transport water into their cities and irrigate their fields .	Olmec
[MASK] grew maize , squash , beans , and tomatoes .	They
[MASK] also bred small domesticated dogs which , along with fish , provided their protein .	They
Although no one knows what happened to the Olmec after about 400 BCE , in part because the jungle reclaimed many of their cities , their [MASK] was the base upon which the Maya and the Aztec built .	culture
The [MASK] also developed a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica , giving rise to an elite class .	Olmec
The [MASK] carved heads from giant boulders that ranged from four to eleven feet in height and could weigh up to fifty tons .	Olmec
All these [MASK] have flat noses , slightly crossed eyes , and large lips .	figures
After the decline of the Olmec , a [MASK] rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica .	city
Large - scale [MASK] and the resultant abundance of food allowed time for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming .	agriculture
[MASK] constructed over twenty - two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families , as well as more than a hundred temples .	Builders
The [MASK] was also the center for trade , which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica ’s Gulf Coast .	city
The [MASK] were one Mesoamerican culture that had strong ties to Teotihuacan .	Maya
The Maya ’s architectural and mathematical [MASK] were significant .	contributions
Flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE in what is now Mexico , Belize , Honduras , and Guatemala , the [MASK] perfected the calendar and written language the Olmec had begun .	Maya
[MASK] devised a written mathematical system to record crop yields and the size of the population , and to assist in trade .	They
Surrounded by farms relying on primitive agriculture , [MASK] built the city - states of Copan , Tikal , and Chichen Itza along their major trade routes , as well as temples , statues of gods , pyramids , and astronomical observatories ( Figure 1.5 ) .	they
However , because of poor soil and a drought that lasted nearly two centuries , their [MASK] declined by about 900 CE and they abandoned their large population centers .	civilization
[MASK] Castillo , located at Chichen Itza in the eastern Yucatán peninsula , served as a temple for the god Kukulkan .	El
Each [MASK] contains ninety - one steps to the top .	side
When counting the top platform , the total [MASK] of stairs is three hundred and sixty - five , the number of days in a year .	number
The [MASK] found little organized resistance among the weakened Maya upon their arrival in the 1520s .	Spanish
However , [MASK] did find Mayan history , in the form of glyphs , or pictures representing words , recorded in folding books called codices ( the singular is codex ) .	they
In 1562 , [MASK] Diego de Landa , who feared the converted natives had reverted to their traditional religious practices , collected and burned every codex he could find .	Bishop
Today only a [MASK] survive .	few
1. [MASK] of the following Indian peoples built homes in cliff dwellings that still exist ?	Which
2. Which [MASK] developed the first writing system in the Western Hemisphere ?	culture
Despite how much humans have in common , cultural [MASK] are far more prevalent than cultural universals .	differences
For example , while all cultures have language , [MASK] of particular language structures and conversational etiquette reveal tremendous differences .	analysis
North [MASK] keep more distance and maintain a large “ personal space . ”	Americans
Even [MASK] as simple as eating and drinking varies greatly from culture to culture .	something
If your professor comes into an early morning class holding a mug of liquid , what do [MASK] assume she is drinking ?	you
The [MASK] cuisines vary across cultures fascinates many people .	way
Some [MASK] pride themselves on their willingness to try unfamiliar foods , like celebrated food writer Anthony Bourdain , while others return home expressing gratitude for their native culture ’s fare .	travelers
Often , [MASK] in the United States express disgust at other cultures ’ cuisine and think that it ’s gross to eat meat from a dog or guinea pig , for example , while they do n’t question their own habit of eating cows or pigs .	people
Such [MASK] are an example of ethnocentrism , or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one ’s own cultural norms .	attitudes
[MASK] , as sociologist William Graham Sumner ( 1906 ) described the term , involves a belief or attitude that one ’s own culture is better than all others .	Ethnocentrism
Almost [MASK] is a little bit ethnocentric .	everyone
For example , [MASK] tend to say that people from England drive on the “ wrong ” side of the road , rather than on the “ other ” side .	Americans
[MASK] might question , " Far east of where ? "	One
A high [MASK] of appreciation for one ’s own culture can be healthy ; a shared sense of community pride , for example , connects people in a society .	level
But [MASK] can lead to disdain or dislike for other cultures and could cause misunderstanding and conflict .	ethnocentrism
[MASK] with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to “ help ” its people , because they see them as uneducated or backward - essentially inferior .	People
In reality , these [MASK] are guilty of cultural imperialism , the deliberate imposition of one ’s own cultural values on another culture .	travelers
European [MASK] often viewed the people in the lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance , dress , religion , and other cultural practices .	colonizers
A more modern [MASK] of cultural imperialism may include the work of international aid agencies who introduce agricultural methods and plant species from developed countries while overlooking indigenous varieties and agricultural approaches that are better suited to the particular region .	example
[MASK] can be so strong that when confronted with all of the differences of a new culture , one may experience disorientation and frustration .	Ethnocentrism
In sociology , [MASK] call this culture shock .	we
A [MASK] from Chicago might find the nightly silence of rural Montana unsettling , not peaceful .	traveler
Perhaps the Chicago [MASK] was initially captivated with Montana ’s quiet beauty and the Chinese student was originally excited to see a U.S. - style classroom firsthand .	traveler
But as they experience unanticipated differences from their own culture , their [MASK] gives way to discomfort and doubts about how to behave appropriately in the new situation .	excitement
Eventually , as people learn more about a culture , [MASK] recover from culture shock .	they
Culture [MASK] may appear because people are n’t always expecting cultural differences .	shock
[MASK] Ken Barger ( 1971 ) discovered this when he conducted a participatory observation in an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic .	Anthropologist
Originally from Indiana , [MASK] hesitated when invited to join a local snowshoe race .	Barger
[MASK] knew he ’d never hold his own against these experts .	He
Sure enough , [MASK] finished last , to his mortification .	he
But the tribal [MASK] congratulated him , saying , “ You really tried ! ”	members
In Barger ’s own culture , [MASK] had learned to value victory .	he
Over the course of his stay , [MASK] participated in caribou hunts , learned how to take shelter in winter storms , and sometimes went days with little or no food to share among tribal members .	Barger
During his time with the Inuit tribe , [MASK] learned to engage in cultural relativism .	Barger
Cultural [MASK] is the practice of assessing a culture by its own standards rather than viewing it through the lens of one ’s own culture .	relativism
Even the most culturally relativist [MASK] from egalitarian societies — ones in which women have political rights and control over their own bodies — would question whether the widespread practice of female genital mutilation in countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan should be accepted as a part of cultural tradition .	people
[MASK] attempting to engage in cultural relativism , then , may struggle to reconcile aspects of their own culture with aspects of a culture that they are studying .	Sociologists
Sometimes when people attempt to rectify feelings of ethnocentrism and develop cultural relativism , [MASK] swing too far to the other end of the spectrum .	they
[MASK] is the opposite of ethnocentrism , and refers to the belief that another culture is superior to one ’s own .	Xenocentrism
( The Greek root [MASK] xeno , pronounced “ ZEE-no , ” means “ stranger ” or “ foreign guest . ” )	word
By the end of this section , [MASK] will be able to :	you
[MASK] preferred to think that it is space and time that are affected by the presence of a large mass ; light beams , and everything else that travels through space and time , then find their paths affected .	Einstein
[MASK] always follows the shortest path — but that path may not always be straight .	Light
This [MASK] is true for human travel on the curved surface of planet Earth , as well .	idea
Since an airplane ca n’t go through the solid body of the Earth , the shortest [MASK] is not a straight line but the arc of a great circle .	distance
[MASK] explain that your dorm is at 6400 College Avenue , a street that runs in the left - right direction on a map of your town ; you are on the fifth floor , which tells where you are in the up - down direction ; and you are the sixth room back from the elevator , which tells where you are in the forward - backward direction .	You
Then [MASK] explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. ( but was soon brought under control ) , which specifies the event in time .	you
[MASK] considered space and time to be completely independent , and that continued to be the accepted view until the beginning of the twentieth century .	Newton
But [MASK] showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time , and that only by considering the two together — in what we call spacetime — can we build up a correct picture of the physical world .	Einstein
[MASK] examine spacetime a bit more closely in the next subsection .	We
The gist of Einstein ’s general theory is that the [MASK] of matter curves or warps the fabric of spacetime .	presence
When something else — a beam of light , an electron , or the starship Enterprise — enters such a region of distorted spacetime , its [MASK] will be different from what it would have been in the absence of the matter .	path
As American physicist John Wheeler summarized it : “ [MASK] tells spacetime how to curve ; spacetime tells matter how to move . ”	Matter
The [MASK] of distortion in spacetime depends on the mass of material that is involved and on how concentrated and compact it is .	amount
Terrestrial [MASK] , such as the book you are reading , have far too little mass to introduce any significant distortion .	objects
Newton ’s [MASK] of gravity is just fine for building bridges , skyscrapers , or amusement park rides .	view
General [MASK] does , however , have some practical applications .	relativity
The [MASK] ( Global Positioning System ) in every smartphone can tell you where you are within 5 to 10 meters only because the effects of general and special relativity on the GPS satellites in orbit around the Earth are taken into account .	GPS
Unlike a book or your roommate , [MASK] produce measurable distortions in spacetime .	stars
A white [MASK] , with its stronger surface gravity , produces more distortion just above its surface than does a red giant with the same mass .	dwarf
So , you see , [MASK] are eventually going to talk about collapsing stars again , but not before discussing Einstein ’s ideas ( and the evidence for them ) in more detail .	we
How can [MASK] understand the distortion of spacetime by the presence of some ( significant ) amount of mass ?	we
[MASK] may have seen maps of New York City that squeeze the full three dimensions of this towering metropolis onto a flat sheet of paper and still have enough information so tourists will not get lost .	You
[MASK] 24.7 , for example , shows the progress of a motorist driving east on a stretch of road in Kansas where the countryside is absolutely flat .	Figure
Since our motorist is traveling only in the east - west direction and the terrain is flat , [MASK] can ignore the other two dimensions of space .	we
From A to B [MASK] drove at a uniform speed ; unfortunately , it was too fast a uniform speed and a police car spotted him .	he
From B to C [MASK] stopped to receive his ticket and made no progress through space , only through time .	he
From C to D [MASK] drove more slowly because the police car was behind him .	he
This [MASK] shows the progress of a motorist traveling east across the flat Kansas landscape .	diagram
In this case , [MASK] will ( in our imaginations ) use a rubber sheet that can stretch or warp if we put objects on it .	we
To complete the analogy , [MASK] need something that normally travels in a straight line ( as light does ) .	we
[MASK] begin with just the rubber sheet and the ant , simulating empty space with no mass in it .	We
[MASK] put the ant on one side of the sheet and it walks in a beautiful straight line over to the other side ( Figure 24.8 ) .	We
[MASK] next put a small grain of sand on the rubber sheet .	We
The [MASK] does distort the sheet a tiny bit , but this is not a distortion that we or the ant can measure .	sand
If we send the ant so it goes close to , but not on top of , the sand grain , [MASK] has little trouble continuing to walk in a straight line .	it
Now [MASK] grab something with a little more mass — say , a small pebble .	we
[MASK] bends or distorts the sheet just a bit around its position .	It
If we send the ant into this region , [MASK] finds its path slightly altered by the distortion of the sheet .	it
The [MASK] is not large , but if we follow the ant ’s path carefully , we notice it deviating slightly from a straight line .	distortion
The [MASK] gets more noticeable as we increase the mass of the object that we put on the sheet .	effect
Such a heavy [MASK] distorts or warps the rubber sheet very effectively , putting a good sag in it .	object
From our point of view , [MASK] can see that the sheet near the paperweight is no longer straight .	we
The common [MASK] of location are quartiles and percentiles .	measures
[MASK] are special percentiles .	Quartiles
The first [MASK] , Q 1 , is the same as the 25th percentile , and the third quartile , Q 3 , is the same as the 75th percentile .	quartile
To calculate quartiles and percentiles , [MASK] must order the data from smallest to largest .	you
[MASK] divide ordered data into quarters .	Quartiles
[MASK] divide ordered data into hundredths .	Percentiles
So , [MASK] mean the data is divided into 100 sections .	percentiles
[MASK] means that 90 percent of test scores are the same as or less than your score and that 10 percent of the test scores are the same as or greater than your test score .	It
[MASK] are useful for comparing values .	Percentiles
For this reason , [MASK] and colleges use percentiles extensively .	universities
One [MASK] in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor .	instance
[MASK] translates into a score of at least 1220 .	That
Therefore , if you were to say that 90 percent of the test scores are less , and not the same or less , than your score , [MASK] would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant .	it
The [MASK] is a number that measures the center of the data .	median
[MASK] can think of the median as the middle value , but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values .	You
[MASK] is a number that separates ordered data into halves .	It
Half the [MASK] are the same number or smaller than the median , and half the values are the same number or larger .	values
When a data set has an even number of data values , the [MASK] is equal to the average of the two middle values when the data are arranged in ascending order ( least to greatest ) .	median
When a data set has an odd number of data values , the [MASK] is equal to the middle value when the data are arranged in ascending order .	median
Since there are 14 observations ( an even number of data values ) , the [MASK] is between the seventh value , 6.8 , and the eighth value , 7.2 .	median
( [MASK] + 7.2 ) / 2 = 7	6.8
The [MASK] is seven .	median
[MASK] of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven .	Half
[MASK] are numbers that separate the data into quarters .	Quartiles
[MASK] may or may not be part of the data .	Quartiles
The first [MASK] , Q 1 , is the middle value of the lower half of the data , and the third quartile , Q 3 , is the middle value , or median , of the upper half of the data .	quartile
The data [MASK] has an even number of values ( 14 data values ) , so the median will be the average of the two middle values ( the average of 6.8 and 7.2 ) , which is calculated as ( 6.8 + 7.2 ) / 2 and equals 7 .	set
So , the [MASK] , or second quartile ( Q 2 ) , is 7 .	median
The first [MASK] is the median of the lower half of the data , so if we divide the data into seven values in the lower half and seven values in the upper half , we can see that we have an odd number of values in the lower half .	quartile
Thus , the [MASK] of the lower half , or the first quartile ( Q 1 ) will be the middle value , or 2 .	median
Using the same procedure , [MASK] can see that the median of the upper half , or the third quartile ( Q 3 ) will be the middle value of the upper half , or 9 .	we
The interquartile [MASK] is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half , or the middle 50 percent of the data .	range
[MASK] is the difference between the third quartile ( Q 3 ) and the first quartile ( Q 1 )	It
[MASK] = Q 3 – Q 1 .	IQR
The [MASK] can help to determine potential outliers .	IQR
Potential [MASK] always require further investigation .	outliers
A potential [MASK] is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points .	outlier
These special data [MASK] may be errors or some kind of abnormality , or they may be a key to understanding the data .	points
[MASK] are in dollars .	Prices
The following [MASK] are in dollars .	salaries
In the example above , [MASK] just saw the calculation of the median , first quartile , and third quartile .	you
These three [MASK] are part of the five number summary .	values
The other two [MASK] are the minimum value ( or min ) and the maximum value ( or max ) .	values
[MASK] is Wednesday .	Today
[MASK] started out this vlog outside because I really wanted to sit outside in this like beautiful weather and talk to you while I was eating my snack , and like , I just finished filming a main channel video out there , but then my neighbor came outside and like , things got kind of awkward .	I
[MASK] just feel awkward being like " what 's up guys , " like , I do n't know when my neighbors are out in their backyard .	I
So [MASK] 'm just gon na let them have their peace and quiet , but I just finished my snack .	I
[MASK] have a lot to do today .	I
But like [MASK] said .	I
Are [MASK] as distracting to you as they are for me ?	these
Sorry , hi , [MASK] 's me now .	it
My [MASK] is breaking out so badly .	face
[MASK] mentioned it in the last vlog .	I
[MASK] think it 's hormonal .	I
I do n't know , like [MASK] washed my makeup brushes .	I
[MASK] changed my pillowcases once to twice a week .	I
[MASK] am like diligent , like vigilant even about my skincare routine .	I
So [MASK] do n't really know what 's going on .	I
[MASK] think it 's hormonal , but anyways , this is just real life and I 've really been struggling with my appearance lately .	I
[MASK] 's been a really sore spot for me .	It
I — [MASK] 're just jumping right into it , are n't we ?	we
[MASK] 'm just being honest , like , I am not in a good place with the way I look .	I
And [MASK] also think I put way too much emphasis on what I look like , and the fact that I 'm putting this on the internet and that I , like , get like this for the internet , is huge for me , it 's always been huge for me , but also it 's really hard when I 'm editing .	I
[MASK] have a really hard time , like just grappling with my appearance at times , and that 's a really toxic thing for your mental health .	I
And so [MASK] 'm trying to break out of that , and I do n't know , maybe some of you are also dealing with the same thing and are struggling with , I do n't know , I just feel ugly .	I
[MASK] feel ugly all the time .	I
And [MASK] know that 's not the case and ugly is such a subjective word .	I
And also [MASK] feel like it 's a word meant to like , oppress people , particularly women , but I 've just been having a hard time with the way I look .	I
So it 's just , [MASK] 's been rough .	it
And [MASK] think I 'm zooming out right now in my head and realizing that it 's been two , almost two years of this shit , and that I obviously need to be more gentle with myself and I think I 'm in the process of doing that , and this week , particularly I 've been moving my body a little bit more and it 's been feeling really good .	I
And also , [MASK] 'm very proud to say that I have actually gone back to therapy , which is something that I have n't done since — I mean the last time I was in therapy , almost I was like 20 .	I
[MASK] 'm 33 .	I
Your [MASK] 's got trauma like , it 's way past due .	girl
[MASK] think in the past I have really put off therapy because I was n't ready to like open old wounds .	I
And [MASK] takes a lot sometimes when you 're in therapy , like it takes a toll on you mentally .	it
And so , [MASK] knew that things were gon na have to get unearthed and things were definitely gon na have to get worse before they got better .	I
And [MASK] 've only just started , but I 'm already feeling really good in that I 'm taking this step towards bettering myself and it makes me really happy .	I
And [MASK] was just like , wow , thanks .	I
So [MASK] did bring that up , the whole thing I was talking about before in therapy , where I have a really hard time with my appearance .	I
In fact , [MASK] becomes like an obsession and I obsess over little , every angle and thing .	it
And [MASK] probably does n't seem that way , by the way I feel myself , but it 's always just something that 's in here , do you know what I mean ?	it
[MASK] know you all appreciate when I have these talks and you know , just kind of like get real with you .	I
So anyways , today [MASK] have quite a bit of filming to do .	I
[MASK] just filmed my like portion of a main channel video that was outside , that was really fun .	I
[MASK] think maybe in this video , this vlog , I 'm just in the mood to talk , you know , I do n't really have much to show .	I
[MASK] 'm not really doing anything this week other than like hunkering down and doing as much work as possible .	I
[MASK] do n't think , maybe in the next vlog I might do some fall things , excuse me .	I
[MASK] 'm really just kind of preparing to go out of town next week and I have like a lot of deadlines and stuff before then .	I
So I do n't , [MASK] kinda just wan na chat .	I
Okay , [MASK] 'm gon na try not --	I
[MASK] 'm trying .	I
[MASK] 'm trying .	I
[MASK] 'm just being honest , I was just about to say we need to do something about this .	I
[MASK] still feel that way , but I 'm working on it .	I
So [MASK] 've been planning to vlog today um because I was going to do like a little productive day of my life blah blah blah but then I literally had a mental breakdown at 4 am last night .	I
And I was like , [MASK] ca n't vlog tomorrow because I 'm just not gon na have the mental energy or the physical energy to do anything productive .	I
Like [MASK] did n't even think I would be able to wake up for my 8:15 a.m. yoga class that I signed up for , but I am awake .	I
So [MASK] was kind of like , maybe I should vlog today and just see how my day turns around because we 're getting off on a rough start right now .	I
But yeah , [MASK] will just take you guys through another day in my life .	I
[MASK] 'll take you guys to yoga with me and we 'll just see if things improve .	I
[MASK] have my glasses on now .	I
Um [MASK] 's Wednesday , it 's quite gloomy out .	today
Yeah , [MASK] have my usual co-op today .	I
And then after that , [MASK] have my class , my marketing brand management class .	I
And [MASK] have a meeting tonight .	I
[MASK] 'm gon na start getting ready for my yoga class soon so let 's start doing that .	I
[MASK] got this workout set from Amazon and it is so good .	I
[MASK] 's like really thick and stretchy and comfy and soft .	It
[MASK] is my fit for the day .	This
[MASK] guess I 've come to the conclusion that if I wear more workout clothes , like just in my daily life , then I 'll be more inclined to go to the gym because I do n't have to like change OOTD haha .	I
Alright , [MASK] 'm pretty much all ready to go , I just need to like pack my bag because I am basically just not coming home .	I
[MASK] 'm going to Saxby 's right after to just do all the work I need to do for the day , so yeah .	I
Alright , [MASK] 'm heading out .	I
[MASK] think it 'll be good for me and it 's gon na be relaxing .	I
But , [MASK] 'm running on a lot of coffee and very little sleep today .	I
[MASK] 're done with yoga .	We
[MASK] 's nice .	She
[MASK] gave me a foot massage .	She
That one [MASK] was kind of like , whoa I 'm being touched now .	I
[MASK] was nice , though .	It
[MASK] usually do n't like massages , but like , this was fine .	I
But yeah , [MASK] 're heading to Saxby 's now to do work .	we
[MASK] have a Starbucks bottle with me .	I
[MASK] always get super insecure .	I
[MASK] 're probably looking at me and being like this bitch .	They
[MASK] got Starbucks and went to United by Blue one day and I poured it into a different cup .	I
Are [MASK] fucking kidding me ?	you
[MASK] 's cheaper !	It
[MASK] is cheaper than United by Blue ?	Starbucks
[MASK] 's just like a local cafe .	That
The chai [MASK] is better .	latte
[MASK] 'm in a much better mood than I was this morning .	I
[MASK] literally started the vlog and I was like , " hey ! " .	I
And now [MASK] did yoga !	we
So now [MASK] did yoga .	we
[MASK] is coursing through my body and so is a lot of caffeine .	Serotonin
My co-op [MASK] start in like an hour and I 'm just gon na be doing emails again and again .	hours
But [MASK] 's okay .	that
[MASK] was a terrible vlogger today because I got home and just completely knocked so .	I
Anyways now [MASK] 's like 5:19 p.m.	it

As you can see , we 're [MASK] 're actively making dinner .	we
[MASK] wearing sorority sweatshirts .	Both

[MASK] 're making pesto pasta with penne , roasted peppers , onion , garlic , and avocado .	We
[MASK] Ramsay could never with this technique .	Gordon
You know [MASK] 've been cooking a lot more in my vlogs and I 'm starting to think like , what if Gordon Ramsay is watching my vlogs and just absolutely shitting on me .	I

[MASK] 're taking words out of my mouth .	You
[MASK] just do n't appreciate it .	I
I 'm gon na I 'm gon na [MASK] 'm gon na call this vlog first couple fight , not click bait .	I
Anyways [MASK] 're going to chop these bad boys up .	we

Why do n't [MASK] just use a little bit from all three so we get some color in there ?	we
My [MASK] are gon na be so proud of me that I 'm cooking .	parents
[MASK] hope so .	I
Mom and dad if you 're watching this , [MASK] 'm making healthy food .	I
[MASK] 's delicious .	It
Hi guys , [MASK] 'm the worst and I forgot to do an outro for this .	I
But yeah , [MASK] was just a little day in my life .	that
My [MASK] really did turn around um and I did n't feel as bad as I used to in the morning .	day
So yeah , [MASK] hope you guys enjoyed watching !	I
If you made it to this point in the video , [MASK] are a very good human , and I 'll see you in my next one !	you
Hey , [MASK] 's up everyone ?	what
For those of you who are new here and do n't know me , my [MASK] is Jasmine , and I 'm so glad you 're here on my channel .	name
If you have n't already followed my social media , [MASK] 'll link it right here .	I
My [MASK] are @jasthenurse .	socials
So , if you have n't watched my other video , [MASK] wanted to give you guys an update as to my experience with Covid .	I
For those of you who had n't already watched that video , [MASK] 'm gon na link that video right here so that you can watch it .	I
Um , so essentially , on the 16th of December , [MASK] tested positive for Covid .	I
In this video , [MASK] wanted to update you all regarding my symptoms of Covid and just my overall experience with it .	I
For one , [MASK] can make people more aware and then hopefully make people feel a little bit less alone .	it
So , my first [MASK] , which was on Monday , was a sore throat .	symptom
And the thing is , on Sunday night , [MASK] had gotten back from work around 9:00 pm , so I took a shower .	I
Um [MASK] never really dried my hair , which is so awful , but I decided to go straight to bed because I was so exhausted .	I
[MASK] just wanted to go to sleep .	I
But [MASK] went to bed with my hair wet .	I
And [MASK] know like when you wake up sometimes you have like a sore throat because of the fact that your hair was wet and you were cold ?	you
So , [MASK] assumed oh that like maybe it was just like a sore throat gotten because I did n't bother to you know blow dry my hair .	I
So , [MASK] happened .	that
My [MASK] tests positive .	sister
So , you know like [MASK] go oh shit like I 've been hanging out in the car with her .	I
Even though I was wearing a mask , [MASK] was n't wearing a mask , and she was like obviously coughing um .	she
And so that prolonged period of time , [MASK] were probably in the car with each other for like 40 minutes because we drove one way and then drove back .	we
That Tuesday , [MASK] remember I had been getting a little bit more symptomatic .	I
My sore [MASK] did n't go away , um very very mild symptoms .	throat
[MASK] had booked an appointment or an e-visit with my um insurance to get me tested the next day .	I
So , at night [MASK] was getting really hot then cold then hot and cold .	I
And [MASK] remember at one point I checked my temperature 's only like 98.7 , but at another point it was like 101 or something really high that was obviously a fever .	I
And then around day four , [MASK] started to like stabilize .	everything
Five , [MASK] was like really nothing .	it
Um [MASK] six was when I noticed like the my sinuses were feeling weird .	day
[MASK] was no longer a headache anymore .	It
[MASK] was more like my like congestion like right up here , it was like a weird .	It
[MASK] 's what the feeling was .	That
[MASK] felt like like like there was a sneeze drop in there , and I could n't get it out .	It
Um so , day six and seven , [MASK] started noticing that my taste buds started to change .	I
[MASK] do n't know if you remember the clip of when I had been eating those chips .	I
[MASK] taste so strong to me .	Chips
[MASK] guess that 's like what happens when you lose your taste buds , I do n't know , olfactory nerves , I do n't know .	I
So , from there , [MASK] had gotten um a complete 180 and went from everything being like really heightened sense of taste and even the smell , because I remember I was gargling apple cider vinegar , and I remember smelling it from across the room , and now I ca n't really .	I
Well , [MASK] would say that I have like 30 percent of my taste and smell .	I
So , for example , if you can see my Bath and Body Works candle , [MASK] try to smell that every morning to see if my change in smell changes , and I have like maybe 30 percent of my like smelling capabilities .	I
[MASK] have to get like this close to be able to smell the candle , which is insane because those candles are so strong , you literally open one up and you can smell it all over your room .	I
[MASK] can still smell , but not to my like fullest capability .	I
[MASK] do n't know if you guys have seen those like TikToks where people try and drink different things like pickle juice and water and Gatorade .	I
First of all , [MASK] 's like super inaccurate .	that
When you drink , you can still , for example , [MASK] took like a ginger shot this morning , and it had cayenne pepper .	I
[MASK] can still that feel that burning sensation .	I
So , for example , [MASK] tested if I could drink alcohol , and I drank a Truly , and I can still taste the alcohol like burning sensation going down .	I
So , [MASK] can kind of distinguish if it 's like sweet or salty or tart um , but you ca n't really taste it to its fullest if that makes any sense .	you
Like like for example , [MASK] made mac and cheese , I do n't know if you saw earlier .	I
[MASK] do n't really know exactly how it tastes because I can only like I can kind of taste the cheese , um the saltiness , but it 's more so um I 'm able to feel the textures .	I
[MASK] have a meeting at 10:45 so in a few minutes with one of my TFs about my project .	I
[MASK] 'm gon na meet with her quickly and see if she has any feedback and then I 'll be working on chem and neuro .	I
[MASK] 's not here yet .	She
[MASK] 'm so sorry , I went to the section link .	I
[MASK] was waiting there , I was like " uhm , did I get the time wrong ? "	I
But okay , [MASK] makes a lot more sense .	this
My [MASK] is in a bun .	hair
[MASK] took a shower .	I
[MASK] should let it dry but I 'm too lazy to take it out .	I
[MASK] 's a new day , a little rainy outside .	It
But [MASK] actually like when it 's gloomy for studying because then I feel like there 's nothing else you could be doing , so you might as well just stay inside and work .	I
So [MASK] have some coffee and I 'll be focusing entirely on chem and neuro today , I think .	I
[MASK] is 2:25 a.m.	It
[MASK] 've just been studying for neuroscience , my neuro exam .	I
[MASK] 's currently 2:25 a.m. on Wednesday .	It
[MASK] 've been doing a semi - Pomodoro technique but I 've been doing like working from like half an hour to an hour and then taking like 10 minute breaks .	I
[MASK] do it based off of what I 'm trying to get done because I have my neuroscience final study schedule .	I
[MASK] are the things I 've gotten done , so I got this done , this done , this done .	These
[MASK] 'm currently working on this and then I 'll try to get to this , but if I ca n't then I can do it tomorrow .	I
[MASK] is realistic .	This
[MASK] 'm up very late so I wanted to show that , finals as a college student , you know .	I
So [MASK] 'm going to do what I can and then maybe finish like one or two more lectures and then I will start taking a look at chem .	I
[MASK] will be up for a little while longer .	I
A lot of the notes that I had taken from our last meeting and being more of a cause or like leading to memory 's importance for each of the sources , I — [MASK] essentially changed it to um " it 's the one persistent element of our existence that gives meaning to the inheritance of memory " .	I
How do [MASK] remember ?	we
[MASK] asked this not only as a question of the methods , but also of the circumstances .	I
Oh my god , [MASK] 'm so tired .	I
[MASK] accidentally posted a video I meant to schedule .	I
So now [MASK] have to post about it .	I
[MASK] like deleted Instagram and like was n't really checking social media too much this week , but now I have to redownload it , so I can post about it .	I
[MASK] is May 7th Friday May 7th the day of my final , currently 9:46 a.m.	It
[MASK] 'm going to be taking it at 10 a.m. , so I have 15 minutes .	I
The reason I 'm taking it like this early is because [MASK] have my med school class at two to four thirty , so we have three hours 45 minutes to take it .	I
[MASK] 'm gon na take it at ten , so I can finish around like 1:45 in time for my class .	I
[MASK] 'm nervous .	I
[MASK] 'm really nervous .	I
[MASK] do n't feel too great about it , but I 'm going to be kind to myself with this .	I
[MASK] was a really weird tiring semester , I think , relatively , compared to last semester , so you know , it is what it is .	It
[MASK] 'll try my best and am just gon na take the test , move on , it 's just one more test .	I
[MASK] 's lovely .	That
[MASK] finished my neuroscience exam a little bit after noon .	I
[MASK] is now two o'clock and today is my friend Megumi 's birthday .	It
If you know Megumi then [MASK] 'll know that she is one of my best friends .	you
[MASK] also surprised me on my birthday , so now it 's my turn .	She
[MASK] 'm going to be ordering some donuts to pick up and then head over to her house and surprise her .	I
Okay , [MASK] 's a 16 minute walk .	it
[MASK] will now head over .	I
Well , [MASK] 's exciting !	that
But [MASK] should come outside !	you
Oh , well , [MASK] think you should check your front door .	I
Not at all , [MASK] just think it 's really nice outside .	I

So it 's [MASK] Way here today , and today I 'm going to be talking to you guys about number one : my new product line .	Shawntas
[MASK] have new products out , and I 'm gon na be showing you guys today exactly how I 'm going to be using my products , and I 'm also going to be showing you guys this extreme moisture bomb routine that you can do , um , for wintertime because it is getting a little bit colder outside .	I
Um , which [MASK] always want to focus on the moisture of your hair , but the colder months in some areas of the world can be brutal .	you
Um , [MASK] 's not like super cold w- where I am just yet , but it 's getting there , so ignore my hair right now .	it
[MASK] know it looks kinda crazy .	I
[MASK] 'm gon na tell you guys about that process as well , but first let 's go ahead and get into these products !	I
[MASK] can not believe that I 'm actually showing you guys these products .	I
So this product [MASK] is the Angelic Coco line , and I have been working on this line since 2019 .	line
Um , and you [MASK] will see , like , a lot more stuff in the future , but first we want to focus on these two products .	guys
[MASK] wanted to get these out to you guys because you guys have been asking for styling products since the beginning , so I 'm so glad to finally have actual styling products that I can , um , you know , present to you guys .	I
So this first [MASK] that I 'm going to show you guys is the Nourished by Shawnta Curl Defining and Soft Hold Styler , which is enriched with sesame seed oil and rose essence .	product
So [MASK] 's the Angelic Coco Curl Creator Cream , and it has coconut plus rose in it .	it
So this product is – I just – [MASK] love it .	I
[MASK] 's so moisturizing .	It
[MASK] 's really really thick .	It
You [MASK] can see on the camera it 's super thick .	guys
Um , [MASK] does have like a butter feel to it .	it
[MASK] 's a cream , but it has a really buttery feel to it .	It
And [MASK] 's of course white , hence the name " Angelic Coco " .	it
The [MASK] in here are super jam - packed .	ingredients
[MASK] wanted to make sure that this styler actually contributes to the health of your hair .	I
So a lot of times with stylers , [MASK] 're just , you know , there to give you a nice style , which is great , but I want to make sure that all my products are geared towards the health of the hair even if they 're styling products .	they
So [MASK] was , like , not backing down on that part .	I
As I mentioned , [MASK] of the ingredients is pure honey , along with a lot more nutrient - dense botanicals and herbs .	one
As you guys know , [MASK] 's all I talk about on my channel most of the time .	that
[MASK] really did want to make sure that I infused that into the product as well .	I
If you guys are wondering , the [MASK] of this product is very natural .	smell
[MASK] 's very natural , and it does n't have a strong scent .	It
[MASK] do n't put really really strong scents in my products .	I
I can just like – [MASK] ca n't even begin to tell you how much time and effort I put into this line .	I
And , um , [MASK] 'm just super excited .	I
I just – [MASK] do n't know what to say .	I
[MASK] 'm like " What else can I say ? What else can I say ? "	I
[MASK] do n't know what to say .	I
[MASK] 'm just so excited to finally , like , give it to you guys and know that it 's gon na contribute to the actual health of your hair .	I
[MASK] can use this on twist outs .	You
[MASK] can use this on braid outs .	You
[MASK] can even use it on your wash - n - go as well .	You
But I will say with wash - n - go's a- on my channel , [MASK] always show you guys wash - n - go's where I put a gel on there .	I
So [MASK] could not come out with a cream and tell you guys just – " You can use it on your wash - n - go's " when that would kinda go against all that I 've always said on my channel , which is " Gels actually are what make your wash - n - go stay . "	I
So [MASK] brings us to the next product , which is my curl defining jelly .	that
[MASK] have a gel as well , so it 's not just a cream .	I
[MASK] have another styler as well , which is a gel .	I
So the next [MASK] is the Angelic Clear Coarse Jelly with aloe plus rosemary , and it 's a curl - defining and light - to - medium whole jelly , and it 's enriched with aloe vera juice , which is amazing .	product
So with gels – a lot of times [MASK] will find gels that kinda , like , dry out your hair .	you
But a lot of times [MASK] kinda , like , deal with it because , you know , the gel is what 's gon na keep our hair in place and make it actually last .	we
So [MASK] wanted to make a gel that did not do any of those things .	I
So this [MASK] is going to give a light - to - medium health .	gel
You guys already know that – if you follow my channel for a while , [MASK] know that I use , like , light defining gels and jellies and stuff all throughout my channel .	you
Um , and more of the harder gels that really , like , make your hair feel super hard – [MASK] do n't normally use those because I do n't feel like you need all that .	I
[MASK] just need , like , a nice holding gel .	You
So [MASK] just slept in today because it 's our last day here in Glacier and we 've been getting up at five o'clock every morning so that we could get into the park and get hiking early .	we
And on our last day [MASK] were like " we 're sleeping in " .	we
So [MASK] slept to like 7:15 today .	we
Anyways [MASK] just wanted to show you guys this is what our shoes look like every day after we get done hiking in Glacier .	I
[MASK] 're super super super dusty .	They
[MASK] 's how the paths are , so I have to clean them every day um but yeah .	That
So [MASK] 's fun just a heads up , hiking in Glacier , it 's not muddy it 's just the dusty dirt paths are very dusty .	that
But hey [MASK] just wanted to give a shout out to these Adidas Terrex shoes , I literally bought these hiking shoes right before our trip .	I
[MASK] literally arrived on my doorstep the day before we left for the trip because I needed some new hiking shoes , and these have been absolutely the best hiking shoes I 've ever owned .	They
So if you 're in a need for some new hiking shoes [MASK] definitely recommend these Adidas Terrex .	I
What I like about these is that [MASK] 're tennis shoe - like then they have the rubber soles on the front for if you 're walking through , like , wet grass areas and the grip on these guys are amazing .	they
So [MASK] have been awesome for hiking and I highly recommend them , especially if you 're looking for like a lighter shoe that 's not heavy like hiking boots or anything .	these
[MASK] have been great .	These
So [MASK] 's our last day and we are just driving the uh – Going to the Sun Road and we ’re just gon na stop along wherever we want to go .	it
[MASK] 're not having any plans today and right now we are at like a river waterfall area , so yeah we 're just gon na kind of roll with whatever happens today , so just chill , relax and enjoy our last day in beautiful Glacier National Park !	We
Alright so [MASK] think we 're gon na just do a tiny bit of hiking this morning just to kind of get out and move , and we feel pretty good from hiking 12 miles yesterday , like we 're totally ready to go again .	I
So [MASK] 's good !	that
So [MASK] think we 're gon na start here at the loop trailhead which is the same highline – um , trail that we did the other day .	I
[MASK] 's just the other end of it , um , so we 're just gon na hike a little bit on that .	It
[MASK] is overcast today and they said there could be some rain , so we 're probably gon na go far and that 's okay .	It
[MASK] really want to just chill out today so um we 're just gon na hike and see what happens .	We
[MASK] is a pretty cool little thing that is posted here at the loop so this Going - To - The - Sun Road is actually considered a national landmark now , how cool .	This
1997 [MASK] declared it .	they
[MASK] 's so cool .	That
[MASK] 's one of the best roads in the US I feel , it 's amazing .	It
And [MASK] ’re in grizzly bear country !	we
[MASK] got the bear spray though .	We
Alright , [MASK] think we made it about a mile on the loop and I think we 're gon na turn around because thing is it 's all uphi- uphill and we 're just we 're being lazy today .	I
[MASK] 've been hiking 10 plus miles a day so , you know what , last day we 're gon na – we 're gon na chill .	We
And yeah [MASK] 'm gon na head back and then just keep driving and stop along the way .	I
[MASK] 's just a really big like traffic jam here on the road .	It
[MASK] could n't get it on my camera .	I
[MASK] was like too far away and then she 'd like go into the bush and stuff but I do have my big Canon and I was able to get some photos of her but that was cool !	She
[MASK] finally seen grizzly bears !	We
Because [MASK] have n't seen any yet and it 's our last day so we were really hoping to see some today and we did !	we
[MASK] was huge !	She
[MASK] was a big big big mama .	She
So [MASK] 's so cool I 'm so glad we found .	that
Guys so [MASK] had an awesome lazy day in the park today and now we are ending our time in Glacier with some pizza .	we
[MASK] got beers at Pizza Hut in Montana !	We
Montana , [MASK] can get beer .	you
It 's not even – [MASK] 's not three - two , it 's like real good .	it
[MASK] 's real beer , not three two , yes .	It
[MASK] 's the real deal	It
Alright Pizza [MASK] was awesome and now we went and got some ice cream .	Hut
[MASK] 're so healthy .	We
[MASK] ’re the healthiest .	We
[MASK] told him a small .	I
[MASK] 's bigger in Montana .	Everything
[MASK] 's bigger in Montana .	Everything
[MASK] ’s huge .	It
But anyways [MASK] 're just down by this river here that 's like right here in Columbia Falls and we 're going to eat our ice cream and enjoy our last evening here .	we
Alright you guys , [MASK] 's our last day here and at Glacier National Park .	it
[MASK] is windy as you can see	It
[MASK] just wanted to thank you guys so much for watching our vlog .	I
[MASK] had such a great time being back in Glacier and I hope this inspired you to come out here and see one of our most favorite national parks we 've ever been to in the USA .	We
[MASK] have a 10 hour drive today ahead of us .	We
[MASK] are heading to Gillette , Wyoming and then from there we are going to be heading into South Dakota .	We
[MASK] 's like lipstick central .	It
[MASK] 's actually pretty crazy in here .	It
Eventually I actually — maybe [MASK] can check for this at Target .	we
[MASK] actually want to get one of those acrylic things where the lipsticks can just stand up in it and it looks super neat .	I
Like [MASK] 's definitely what I want .	that
But [MASK] also need to clear a lot of these out because I know a lot of these lipsticks are at least over like two three years old and that 's like not okay .	I
My fancy lipsticks — [MASK] ca n't part with them yet .	I
I just [MASK] literally ca n't so I 'm gon na keep those .	I
Okay so [MASK] is a Pat McGrath lipstick .	this
[MASK] 's like the most beautiful red lipstick .	It
[MASK] feel like I do n't want to throw it away .	I
But anyways , so on the bottom of this lipstick [MASK] can see where it says eighteen months is the shelf life so .	you
Can [MASK] all see this ?	you
[MASK] will definitely insert a little clip here that will show you what the shelf life symbol looks like on products .	I
So [MASK] will find this on all your cosmetics , your makeup .	you
[MASK] is usually on there .	It
So when it says eighteen M [MASK] means that product , after eighteen months , is expired .	that
[MASK] feel like this is not too far past eighteen months , and I mean look at the red .	I
[MASK] 's beautiful , so I ca n't part with it .	It
[MASK] is a problem .	This
The [MASK] rang .	doorbell
[MASK] 's at the door Hershey ?	Who
[MASK] 'll be right back .	I
[MASK] got to get the door .	I
[MASK] 're gon na spring clean with me ?	You
Yes [MASK] are !	you
Guys [MASK] love her so much !	I
Hershey [MASK] 's your first vlog .	it
[MASK] 're doing great .	You
[MASK] also love this .	I
[MASK] love this color .	I
[MASK] says twelve months .	This
One hundred percent [MASK] is definitely definitely expired , but it 's just with lipsticks it 's kind of hard to tell .	this
Like — like usually with foundations when it 's expired , [MASK] will see the oil separating and all that , but this just looks — it looks fine .	you
Alright [MASK] is this ?	what
Oh [MASK] is Ofra !	this
Oh my god I had this back in college is when [MASK] ordered this , which is probably around twenty sixteen .	I
[MASK] is four years old .	This
[MASK] has like rubbed off of it .	Everything
[MASK] has one thousand percent got to go in the throw away pile .	This
Oh [MASK] looks kind of dry and crusty too .	it
How [MASK] of you people actually knew that makeup expires ?	many
Cuz [MASK] actually did not know and actually did n't realize what that symbol meant until I heard other people talking about it and I was like wait what ? .	I
Next up [MASK] got Ashton Liquid Lipstick by Anastasia Beverly Hills .	we
[MASK] is wild .	That
[MASK] definitely had this for at least — at least four years cuz I definitely had this in college as well .	I
Yeah [MASK] 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .	that
So [MASK] of Colors definitely does not have an expiration date on their products .	Dose
[MASK] do n't know if this means that they just do n't expire or I do n't know .	I
[MASK] do n't know what that means .	I
[MASK] 'm a just put all the Dose of Color in a separate pile cuz that 's kind of weird .	I
[MASK] might need to research that a little bit .	I
[MASK] is an expired lipstick .	That
Okay so the fancy [MASK] have a shelf life of twelve months , so one full year .	lipsticks
[MASK] know I 've definitely had this over a year though .	I
[MASK] think .	I
Have [MASK] had this over a year ?	I
But yeah [MASK] just does not look good .	this
[MASK] 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .	That
This [MASK] is also not looking good .	black
[MASK] feel like I 've only had the black since last year Halloween though .	I
Or was [MASK] the Halloween before ?	it
Guys [MASK] is harder than I thought .	this
[MASK] ca n't remember when I bought things .	I
[MASK] 's not looking good though .	It
[MASK] 's all like super separated .	It
[MASK] do n't like how that looks .	I
Oh so [MASK] is interesting .	this
[MASK] Up actually has twenty four months of shelf life for their lip pencils which is really really good .	Black
[MASK] 's two years .	That
But is [MASK] actually good ?	that
Does [MASK] mean that this is chocked full of preservatives ?	that
[MASK] 's like not healthy for you ?	That
[MASK] do n't know !	I
But [MASK] 've definitely had this for more than two years .	I
This blue [MASK] is definitely old .	lipstick
[MASK] do n't know if you can actually tell by looking at it but she 's old .	I
[MASK] 's interesting .	That
The Urban [MASK] does not have a shelf life on the actual stick .	Decay
So [MASK] know how lipsticks usually come in packaging ?	you
[MASK] usually comes in that little box ?	It
[MASK] 'm thinking that maybe Dose of Colors and Urban Decay have the shelf life printed on those boxes but who keeps their lipsticks in a box ?	I
Like how do [MASK] know now if this is expired or not ?	I
[MASK] 've definitely had this over two years though so I 'm just gon na go ahead and throw it in the expired pile .	I
[MASK] feel like two years is kind of the limit that I 've seen so far .	I
[MASK] has a shelf life of six months !	This
So [MASK] is the throw out slash expired pile .	this
[MASK] is the I do n't know what to do with it pile , but I think these are all the Dose of Colors lipsticks that I know I 've had for at least over two years .	This
Hey [MASK] ’s Jackie and welcome back to my vlog channel .	it

Why are you not in – why are [MASK] not over there anymore ?	you

[MASK] ’re here !	We
[MASK] was my favorite area in the park , maybe because it was n’t as crowded yet and the wand shop is so epic .	This
[MASK] is really detailed and when you look up even on the way going into the shop there are owls that move up high .	Everything

[MASK] can work here !	You
[MASK] looks beautiful !	It
[MASK] got it !	You
[MASK] 'll grab us some plates .	I
[MASK] looks beautiful !	It
Ohh , [MASK] thought it was V .	I
So [MASK] 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich .	I
Salt vinegar [MASK] are my crisp of choice .	squares
And [MASK] 've got some apple juice because this signifies kind of my diet staples the last few weeks .	I
So [MASK] thought this was an opportune time to tell you all that a couple of weeks ago I found out that I am pregnant .	I
[MASK] 's the first week that I 've been actually able to say the words " I 'm pregnant " and have it not feel really weird .	It
[MASK] found out on , I think it was the 3rd of January .	I
[MASK] found out on the fifth and that was because my period was late and I am never late .	I
As soon as I came off the pill my [MASK] came back pretty regularly and I started tracking my periods just because I knew the pregnancy was something that eventually we would want , and I know that it helps if you 've been tracking your period so you know your cycle .	period
And for the first few days / couple of weeks [MASK] felt really anxious , really scared , really worried , because my initial reaction was , and still now , I 'm a bit like , I 'm not old enough for this .	I
[MASK] feel like you 're prepared , you 're in a , you know , in a relationship .	You
[MASK] have been for years , we 're adults , but I do n't know what it is .	We
As soon as I found out [MASK] just went back to like a 14 year old girl .	I
[MASK] 'm like " oh my god , what am I gon na tell my mom ? I ca n't be a mom . "	I
So really [MASK] was just very very overwhelmed and anxious so it took a few days for me to really process what happened .	I
[MASK] was quite a shock and it 's such a huge huge thing .	It
[MASK] then started to talk to people about it , that made me feel better .	I
And , [MASK] 'm not really sure what I 'm trying to say .	I
[MASK] do n't want this to be too , like , all over the place but I decided I do want to document this some way , whether I – at first I was like , I do n't need to copy it on YouTube but I definitely wanted to document this in some kind of video form , just because it 's such a huge thing .	I
[MASK] ’re only pregnant for the first time once .	You
But [MASK] did want to document my first trimester to an extent , because when I first found out , I did start to watch videos of people 's first few weeks , but again , maybe because I was n't in a great headspace , that just frightened me , which again was because everyone was just saying how awful they felt , how excited they were , and I did n't feel excited .	I
[MASK] felt worried .	I
[MASK] cried when I told her because I felt so , just , like , oh my god .	I
I mean you , [MASK] feel quite bad when you feel like that , because it 's such a happy thing and now , you know , I – you know , I know I 've kind of accepted .	you
The [MASK] has kind of sunk in .	shock
And [MASK] am happy to tell people , but at first when you 're trying to get your head around it , it 's very daunting and you just feel awful thinking .	I
The [MASK] of telling someone makes me want to burst into tears .	thought
So [MASK] also then helped me to make the decision that I do want to document this , but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight , so I check in every now and again and just let you know how I 've been feeling .	that
But in terms of if I am sick or I 'm not feeling great , [MASK] 'm not gon na vlog whilst I feel like that .	I
[MASK] would n't want to vlog whilst I feel like that if I was just ill anyway .	I
And [MASK] just think it did n't help me seeing people at their worst at the very beginning , because all you hear is doom and gloom .	I
[MASK] decided to wait a few weeks before I even started to talk about it , so I think I 'm about seven weeks .	I
[MASK] am waiting for my first midwife appointment .	I
I went – [MASK] booked the doctors , because the NHS says you need to book a doctor 's appointment , but that was a waste of time and I felt quite bad about taking that appointment .	I
Because in my area [MASK] 'd have to self - refer , so I have n't had any kind of appointment or checkups or anything but I have been tracking – tracking –	you
[MASK] 've got an app called " what to expect " , put in my , you know , cycle situation and have an estimated due date , which is about mid-September .	I
In terms of symptoms , I mean [MASK] have n't felt the best , but I have been able to get through it .	I
[MASK] 've definitely struggled on some days but I have n't been sick .	I
The biggest thing for me is I have lost – [MASK] dipped , and I have lost my appetite .	I
[MASK] do n't have particular aversions to things , I do n't feel really sick when I smell anything at the moment .	I
[MASK] want chips , I want white toast , it 's pretty much all I eat all day .	I
Like , [MASK] craves that at this point because you 're , you know , building a baby , so you need that energy .	everyone
So [MASK] do n't feel particularly great nutrition-wise , and I 'm trying to eat fruit where I can and veg when I can , but I 'm just sort of going with it , because I know there 's enough information out there that this is generally how it goes .	I
And then hopefully [MASK] start to feel a bit better .	you
[MASK] have felt nauseous and as everyone describes it , a bit jet - lagged , a bit cloudy in my head , and the worst thing for me has been headaches .	I
[MASK] have n't had them this week , but last week I had a couple of really really bad ones and I have n't had headaches that bad for years .	I
Well , [MASK] is like the exact opposite .	today
[MASK] is like the calmest water you might have seen .	This
[MASK] is so beautiful .	This
And [MASK] 'm drinking instant coffee , but the instant coffee is actually from Bremen .	I
[MASK] 's crazy , right ?	That
In South Africa [MASK] 'm drinking instant coffee that is from Bremen .	I
[MASK] are heading out here at 10:00 a.m. I think , and then on the way back we 're stopping at a winery for , I do n't know , for looking at it , and then we 're gon na head back .	We
So the Sauvignon Blanc , [MASK] 's naturally high - acidic grape , and then if you smell it you pick up grassy aromas , lots of passion fruits , gooseberry flavors in the palate .	it
So [MASK] is a warmer climate Sauvignon Blanc , well balanced acidity , 2018 vintage , very crisp and fresh and it is unwooded .	this
And then the Chardonnay - Pinot Noir , [MASK] is a blended wine of 60 % Chardonnay and 40 % Pinot Noir , so it 's more like a dry rosé style of wine with lots of strawberry flavors , hints of yellow apple , and it 's 2018 vintage , which is unwooded .	it
[MASK] 's very fresh and crisp .	It
Is [MASK] a popular wine ?	it
Yes , in South Africa Chardonnay and Pinot Noir , [MASK] 's a popular wine .	it
And then with the Chardonnay , [MASK] is naturally high - acidic , but not so much aromatic on the nose , so you pick up lots of citrus fruits , limes , lemons on the palate , and this is 2017 vintage , also unwooded .	Chardonnay
So [MASK] are the type of wine that you can enjoy on their own and also with your light meals , because they are made to open now , drink now wines .	these
Can [MASK] ask you , with your white wines , how – how long – when 's the best time to drink them ?	I
Is [MASK] sooner ?	it
[MASK] 's open now drink now wines , as I said they are lifestyle wines , easy drinking , everyday drinking styles .	It
But if you want to keep them , [MASK] would say 5 years in the cellar .	I
Oh , [MASK] can ?	you
Yes [MASK] can keep them in your cellar , and then the red wines , six years to seven years , not more than that .	you
And then with the red wines from the Signature [MASK] only spent eight months in the French oak .	they
So the reason behind that shorter period of time is for [MASK] to get more of the original flavors from the grapes , not so much of the secondary flavor since they are more level entry wines .	you
So the [MASK] is a uniquely grown South African grape .	Pinotage
So [MASK] 's a high grade grape that is made from Pinot Noir and the Hermitage .	it
[MASK] took a stem of both , cross-breeded them .	You
So the [MASK] is very aromatic , has lots of plum fruits , red fruit flavors .	Pinotage
The [MASK] are full of high tanins , but they are quite soft .	tanins
[MASK] is a 2017 vintage and then the Shiraz , it 's known for its biasing characteristics , that what you pick up on the palette on the nose to the palate , spicy peppery flavor , has lots of great fruits and this is 2017 vintage .	This
So since this one had not much of the oak barrel [MASK] pick up the original black currant fruits , pencil shavings aromas , has lots of black cherries as well .	you
[MASK] is the 2017 vintage .	This
[MASK] 's good !	That
[MASK] will bring the cheese platter .	I
So [MASK] heard it people : whatever she said .	you
To make it a real wine tasting , [MASK] also got a cheese platter .	we
[MASK] 'm just smelling the wine .	I
So [MASK] just saw a wine tasting , and got to say it was really good .	we
[MASK] gave us a little wine .	They
[MASK] feel like my sunburn adds nicely to the effect .	I
[MASK] actually spit it , all of it , in here .	I
No [MASK] did n't .	you
Yeah , [MASK] drank all of it .	I
But [MASK] see all of these glasses ?	you
[MASK] drank all of them .	I
No [MASK] actually drank a few sips –	you
[MASK] 's lying , you drank – you drank most of them .	He
No but this one , this [MASK] was really really good .	one
No which [MASK] 's your favorite wine ?	one
My favorite [MASK] is the Creative Block , yeah Creative Block 5 .	wine
[MASK] 's in there ?	What
[MASK] is a blend of Merlot , Cabernet Sauvignon , Cabernet Franc , Malbec , and Petit Verdot .	It
My [MASK] was the Signature Sauvignon Blanc from Spier .	favorite
So [MASK] 's a white wine .	it
Yeah , [MASK] 's a white wine .	it
For me [MASK] was actually the Creative Block 3 , was this one , with Shiraz , Mourvèdre , Viognier .	it
Actually [MASK] of us did n't choose the most expensive one .	all
Yeah , [MASK] did n't .	we
[MASK] had one of the very expensive ones , and actually none of us liked it the most .	We
[MASK] all liked the inexpensive version of the Pinotage more .	We
[MASK] 's driving , not me .	He

One [MASK] is Quarter Snitch Quidditch .	variation
Another variation is where the [MASK] places the snitch somewhere in the field ( in this case it 's a small ball ) .	referee
The [MASK] has to find the snitch blindfolded , relying only on the coach 's instructions , while the game is still on .	seeker
A [MASK] flying in the air can hurt .	ball
If you 're playing quidditch [MASK] 're probably just having fun so play nicely .	you
The [MASK] treated the crop as sacred and referred to quinoa as " chisaya mama " or " mother of all grains . " [ 1 ]	Incas
By tradition , the Inca [MASK] would sow the first seeds of the season using " golden implements . "	emperor
[MASK] is rich in protein and much lighter than other grains .	Quinoa
[MASK] is much easier to prepare than rice and is rapidly gaining in popularity , especially among vegetarians who value its high protein levels .	It
[MASK] can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box .	You
[MASK] is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed .	This
[MASK] brings out quinoa 's nutty flavor .	This
[MASK] will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat .	Quinoa
[MASK] will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan .	This
The [MASK] should look light and fluffy , and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed .	quinoa
If you bought packaged quinoa , this [MASK] is n't always necessary , but it 's better to be safe than sorry .	step
[MASK] , chicken stock or broth , or vegetable stock all work .	Water
Some rice [MASK] will have different settings instead of a simple " cook " option .	cooker
[MASK] should take no longer than 30 seconds .	This
[MASK] can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly - colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot !	You
Many [MASK] choose to leave out the green , which is lime if you 're using original Skittles , and purple , which is grape in the original style , as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product .	people
However , [MASK] can put them in if you want .	you
If you do n't mind mixed flavors , [MASK] can just skip this step altogether .	you
[MASK] should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles .	You
With single servings like this , [MASK] can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles , if you desire .	you
Once the vodka is cold , [MASK] should be syrupy .	it
[MASK] 'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day .	They
Or [MASK] could just scoop them out when the color dissolves .	you
[MASK] can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste .	You
The lime green [MASK] add a sourness to the drink , so if you want one that 's sweet , leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka .	Skittles
Each [MASK] of vodka ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) requires a large bag worth of Skittles , so if you plan on doing only one flavor for a flavorful vodka , you 'll have to buy 5 large bags of Skittles .	handle
If you plot multiple charts , [MASK] will see a drop area for multi-chart fields .	you
Each [MASK] consists of one point from each data series .	category
Category [MASK] usually appear across the x axis of the chart , although this can vary depending on the type of chart you are using .	labels
Data [MASK] provide the values to be summarized in the chart .	fields
A filter [MASK] is similar to a page field in a Microsoft Excel PivotTable report .	field
For example , when you move a Product field to the filter area , [MASK] can have the chart display category and series values for one product at a time .	you
In the following example , the Salesperson [MASK] is in the MultiChart area , but it 's filtered so it displays individual charts for Buchanan and Davolio .	field
In the following example , [MASK] is the outer field and Salesperson is the inner field .	Year
[MASK] can expand and collapse multiple fields to show more or less information in a particular field .	You
For example , [MASK] can collapse the outer field ( Year ) in the example so that the inner field items are no longer displayed .	you
The [MASK] of a chart does not have to include all fields that are available from the source data .	layout
If more data is available , [MASK] can add fields to the chart .	you
For example , if the chart summarizes sales revenue , and the source data also includes sales quantities , [MASK] might add the Quantity field as a data field to summarize both revenue and quantity of products sold .	you
[MASK] can also remove fields from the chart layout that you no longer want to see .	You
[MASK] means that when you move a series or category field to the filter area and back , previously hidden items are again hidden .	This
When you design a chart for other users , [MASK] can restrict the user 's ability to change the layout of the chart by preventing fields from being added and moved .	you
The data [MASK] displays a tree view of the data model of a data access page .	outline
[MASK] lists the record sources , fields , and calculated controls of a page .	It
Because the field list of a page does not show the contents specific to a page , [MASK] can use the data outline to review the structure of a page .	you
[MASK] can also select the objects displayed in the data outline , set their properties , define and edit relationships between record sources , and delete fields and record sources .	You
The following [MASK] shows the Orders page with two group levels .	illustration
The inner group [MASK] contains fields from the OrderDetails table and a calculated control named Value .	level
In the outer group level , the header [MASK] contains fields from the Orders table and the footer section contains a calculated total control named OrderValue .	section
The following [MASK] shows the data outline for the Orders page .	illustration
The [MASK] in this topic goes to the Web .	hyperlink
[MASK] can switch back to Help at any time .	You
[MASK] can group based on the first n characters of the individual items .	You
For example , [MASK] can group the LastName field by first letter to create groups , such as A , B , and so on .	you
[MASK] can specify the start and end values for the grouping range .	You
[MASK] can randomly select items from a row or column field and group them into higher-level groups .	You
For example , [MASK] can select from the Promotions row field all the promotions that run for a specific period and create a group .	you
[MASK] would add a new row field named Promotions 2 above the Promotions row field with two members : Group1 and Other .	This
[MASK] can change the caption of Group 1 to Fixed and Promotions 2 to Category in the Properties dialog box .	You
The Other [MASK] will contain all items that you did not include in the Fixed custom group .	group
[MASK] can then select all the popular promotions from the Other group and create a new custom group that will be captioned Popular .	You
After you do this , the Category [MASK] will have three members : Fixed , Popular , and Other .	field
The following [MASK] shows how the PivotTable view will look after the captions of the custom group field and custom groups have been changed .	illustration
3 The Other [MASK] is the parent of the items you did not assign to any specific custom group .	group
[MASK] can not group items that belong to different fields or items that belong to parent items into a custom group .	You
When you delete a custom group that is not the last custom group in the field , the deleted group 's [MASK] automatically move to the Other group .	members
The [MASK] you create do not affect source data .	groups
When you move a field that has custom groups between row and column areas , the custom group [MASK] that are based on the field move with the field .	fields
However , the bound [MASK] will show the custom group hierarchy in the drop-down list , so you can filter data by selecting custom groups or individual values .	field
When you move the field back to a row or column area , the custom group [MASK] will appear again .	fields
[MASK] can not move a field with custom groups to the detail area .	You
[MASK] can select two or more custom groups to create a higher-level grouping .	You
For example , [MASK] can group the members of the Category field into two groups : high priority promotions and low priority promotions .	you
The following [MASK] shows how the row area will look with nested custom groups .	illustration
[MASK] can also remove a lower-level custom group .	You
The following [MASK] shows what the data will look like after the Category field has been removed .	illustration
For example , your [MASK] might look like following :	grid
When the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow , [MASK] can drag the line to a new location .	you
If you move the line to the right , the [MASK] between the moving line and the nearest parallel line to the right remains constant , and the perpendicular line to the left of the moving line lengthens .	distance
If you move the line to the left , the [MASK] between the moving line and the nearest parallel line to the right remains constant , and the perpendicular line to the left of the moving line contracts .	distance
Two empty coffee [MASK] sat on the table between them .	cups
In the foreground , facing the magazine rack , a young [MASK] stood with an open magazine in his hands , staring at a picture of a naked woman .	student
[MASK] sat down at the counter and ordered a hamburger and a coffee .	Quinn
As the counterman swung into action , [MASK] spoke over his shoulder to Quinn .	he
Did [MASK] see game tonight , man ?	you
[MASK] missed it . Anything good to report ?	I
What do [MASK] think ?	you
For several years [MASK] had been having the same conversation with this man , whose name he did not know .	Quinn
Once , when he had been in the luncheonette , [MASK] had talked about baseball , and now , each time Quinn came in , they continued to talk about it .	they
In the winter , the [MASK] was of trades , predictions , memories .	talk
During the seasons , [MASK] was always the most recent game .	it
[MASK] were both Mets fans , and the hopelessness of that passion had created a bond between them .	They
The [MASK] shook his head .	counterman
First two times up , [MASK] hits solo shots , he said . Boom , boom . Big mothers – all the way to the moon .	Kingsman
[MASK] is pitching good for once and things do n't look too bad .	Jones
[MASK] 's two to one , bottom of the ninth .	It
[MASK] gets men on second and third , one out , so the Mets go to the bullpen for Allen .	Pittsburgh
[MASK] walks the next guy to load them up .	He
The [MASK] bring the corners in for a force at home , or maybe they can get the double play if it 's hit up the middle .	Mets
[MASK] comes up and chicken-shits a little grounder to first and the fucker goes through Kingman 's legs .	Pena
Two [MASK] score , and that 's it , bye-bye New York .	men
[MASK] should ship him back to Cincinatti by express mail .	They
But [MASK] 'll be tough . Better than last year , anyway .	they
[MASK] looks good on paper , but what do they really have ?	It
[MASK] is always getting hurt .	Stearns
[MASK] have minor leaguers at second and short , and Brooks ca n't keep his mind on the game .	They
[MASK] 's good , but he 's raw , and they ca n't even decide who to put in right .	Mookie
[MASK] and I could go over to Shea tomorrow and get hired as the top two starters .	You
[MASK] could tell those fuckers where to get off .	You
After he finished eating , [MASK] wandered over to the stationery shelves .	Quinn
A [MASK] of new notebooks had come in , and the pile was impressive , a beautiful array of blues and greens and reds and yellows .	shipment
[MASK] picked one up and saw that the pages had the narrow lines he preferred .	He
[MASK] did all his writing with a pen , using a typewriter only for final drafts , and he was always on the lookout for good spiral notebooks .	Quinn
Now that he had embarked on the Stillman case , [MASK] felt that a new notebook was in order .	he
In that way , perhaps , [MASK] might not get out of control .	things
[MASK] looked through the pile , trying to decide which one to pick .	He
For reasons that were never made clear to him , [MASK] suddenly felt an irresistible urge for a particular red notebook at the bottom .	he
[MASK] pulled it out and examined it , gingerly fanning the pages with his thumb .	He
[MASK] was at a loss to explain to himself why he found it so appealing .	He
[MASK] was a standard eight-and-a-half-by-eleven notebook with one hundred pages .	It
But [MASK] about it seemed to call out to him – as if its unique destiny in the world was to hold the words that came from his pen .	something
Almost embarrassed by the intensity of his feelings , [MASK] tucked the red notebook under his arm , walked over to the cash register , and bought it .	Quinn
[MASK] made it to Grand Central well in advance .	He
Stillman 's [MASK] was not due to arrive until six-forty-one , but Quinn wanted time to study the geography of the place , to make sure that Stillman would not be able to slip away from him .	train
As he emerged from the subway and entered the great hall , [MASK] saw by the clock that it was just past four .	he
Already the [MASK] had begun to fill with the rush-hour crowd .	station
Making his way through the press of oncoming bodies , [MASK] made a tour of the numbered gates , looking for hidden staircases , unmarked exits , dark alcoves .	Quinn
[MASK] concluded that a man determined to disappear could do so without much trouble .	He
[MASK] would have to hope that Stillman had not been warned that he would be there .	He
If that were the case , and Stillman managed to elude him , [MASK] would mean that Virginia Stillman was responsible .	it
If Stillman did not show up , [MASK] would go straight to 69th Street and confront Virginia Stillman with what he knew .	Quinn
As he wandered through the station , [MASK] reminded himself of who he was supposed to be .	he
The [MASK] of being Paul Auster , he had begun to learn , was not altogether unpleasant .	effect
Although he still had the same body , the same mind , the same thoughts , [MASK] felt as though he had somehow been taken out of himself , as if he no longer had to walk around with the burden of his own consciousness .	he
By a simple trick of the intelligence , a deft little twist of naming , [MASK] felt incomparably lighter and freer .	he
At the same time , [MASK] knew it was all an illusion .	he
[MASK] had not really lost himself ; he was merely pretending , and he could return to being Quinn whenever he wished .	He
The [MASK] that there was now a purpose to his being Paul Auster – a purpose that was becoming more and more important to him – served as a kind of moral justification for the charade and absolved him of having to defend his lie .	fact
[MASK] wandered through the station , then , as if inside the body of Paul Auster , waiting for Stillman to appear .	He
[MASK] looked up at the vaulted ceiling of the great hall and studied the fresco of constellations .	He
[MASK] had never been able to grasp the connection between the constellations and their names .	Quinn
As a boy [MASK] had spent many hours under the night sky trying to tally the clusters of pinprick lights with the shapes of bears , bulls , archers , and water carriers .	he
But [MASK] had ever come of it , and he had felt stupid , as though there were a blind spot in the center of his brain .	nothing
[MASK] sat there for a short time without saying anything .	They
At last , [MASK] gave a little shrug , which seemed to acknowledge that they had come to an impasse .	Auster
[MASK] stood up and said , I was about to make some lunch for myself .	He
[MASK] hesitated .	Quinn
It was as though [MASK] had read his thoughts , divining the thing he wanted most – to eat , to have an excuse to stay a while .	Auster
I really should be going , [MASK] said .	he
But yes , thank you . A little [MASK] ca n't do any harm .	food
How does a ham [MASK] sound ?	omelette
[MASK] retreated to the kitchen to prepare the food .	Auster
[MASK] would have liked to offer to help , but he could not budge .	Quinn
His [MASK] felt like a stone .	body
For want of any other idea , [MASK] closed his eyes .	he
This time , however , [MASK] found nothing interesting inside his head .	Quinn
[MASK] seemed as though things had ground to a halt in there .	It
Then , from the darkness , [MASK] began to hear a voice , a chanting , idiotic voice that sang the same sentence over and over again : You ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs .	he
[MASK] opened his eyes to make the words stop .	He
[MASK] ate with crude intensity , polishing off the meal in what seemed a matter of seconds .	Quinn
After that , [MASK] made a great effort to be calm .	he
[MASK] lurked mysteriously behind his eyes , and his voice seemed to tremble as he spoke , but somehow he managed to hold his own .	Tears
To prove that he was not a self-obsessed ingrate , [MASK] began to question Auster about his writing .	he
[MASK] was somewhat reticent about it , but at last he conceded that he was working on a book of essays . The current piece was about Don Quixote .	Auster
[MASK] asked him about the essay .	Quinn
[MASK] suppose you can call it speculative , since I 'm not really out to prove anything .	I
In fact , it 's [MASK] done tounge-in-cheek .	all
An imaginative reading , [MASK] guess you could say .	I
[MASK] 's the gist ?	What
[MASK] mostly has to do with the authorship of the book . Who wrote it , and how it was written .	It
[MASK] 's quite simple .	It
[MASK] , if you remember , goes to great lengths to convince the reader that he is not the author .	Cervantes
[MASK] describes how he discovered the manuscript by chance one day in the market at Toledo .	Cervantes
[MASK] hires someone to translate it for him into Spanish ,	He
and thereafter [MASK] presents himself as no more than the editor of the translation .	he
In fact , [MASK] can not even vouch for the accuracy of the translation itself .	he
And yet [MASK] goes on to say , Quinn added , that Cid Hamete Benengali 's is the only true version of Don Quixote 's story .	he
All the other [MASK] are frauds , written by impostors .	versions
[MASK] makes a great point of insisting that everything in the book really happened in the world .	He
Because the [MASK] after all is an attack on the dangers of the make-believe .	book
[MASK] could n't very well offer a work of the imagination to do that , could he ?	He
[MASK] had to claim that it was real .	He
Still , [MASK] 've always suspected that Cervantes devoured those old romances .	I
[MASK] ca n't hate something so violently unless a part of you also loves it .	You
In some sense , [MASK] Quixote was just a stand-in for himself .	Don
[MASK] agree with you .	I
But [MASK] Hamete , the acknowledged author , never makes an appearance .	Cid
Not once does [MASK] claim to be present at what happens .	he
So , my [MASK] is this : who is Cid Hamete Benengali ?	question
Yes , [MASK] see what you 're getting at .	I
The [MASK] I present in the essay is that he is actually a combination of four different people .	theory
[MASK] Panza is of course the witness .	Sancho
But [MASK] can neither read nor write .	Sancho
Therefore , [MASK] can not be the author .	he
On the other hand , [MASK] know that Sancho has a great gift for language .	we
In spite of his inane malapropisms , [MASK] can talk circles around everyone else in the book .	he
[MASK] put the story into proper literary form – in Spanish – and then turned the manuscript over to Samson Carrasco , the bachelor from Salamanca , who proceeded to translate it into Arabic .	They
[MASK] found the translation , had it rendered back into Spanish , and then published the book The Adventures of Don Quixote .	Cervantes
But why would [MASK] and the others go to all that trouble ?	Sancho
[MASK] want to save their friend .	They
The [MASK] of the Sad Countenance does not give up his obsessions .	Knight
Then , at one time or another , [MASK] all go out looking for him in various disguises – as a woman in distress , as the Knight of the Mirrors , as the Knight of the White Moon – in order to lure Don Quixote back home .	they
Do [MASK] know what a physicist is ?	you
Do [MASK] recognize the name of Einstein ? "	you
[MASK] is too much for me .	This
Silent , [MASK] give his case some thought .	I
Busy-minded [MASK] , with their head-culture that touches all surfaces , have heard of Einstein .	people
But do [MASK] know what they have heard ?	they
A [MASK] do not .	majority
These [MASK] choose not to know .	Hasidim
By and by [MASK] open a paperback and try to lose myself in mere politics .	I
A dozen [MASK] in the lavatory queue stare down at us .	Hasidim
[MASK] land and spill out and go our separate ways .	We
At the baggage carousel [MASK] see my youthful Hasid again and we take a final look at each other .	I
In me [MASK] sees what deformities the modern age can produce in the seed of Abraham .	he
In him [MASK] see a piece of history , an antiquity .	I
But then [MASK] is something else again .	Israel
[MASK] are staying in Jerusalem as guests of the Mishkenot Sha'ananim , the dwellings of serenity .	We
Mayor [MASK] Kollek , irrepressible organizer of wonderful events ( some of them too rich for my blood ) , takes us to dinner with one of the Armenian Archbishops in the Old City .	Teddy

The [MASK] are green .	eyes
[MASK] can seldom get up much interest in such cases and objects .	I
Middle-aged [MASK] serve drinks and wait on us .	Armenians
[MASK] wear extremely loud shirts , blue-green sprigged with red berries , but they strike me as good fellows and are neat and nimble about the table .	They
The [MASK] is quick and superknowledgeable .	conversation

The [MASK] , who has himself cooked the eggplant and the leg of lamb , tells the company his recipes .	Archbishop
[MASK] and Kollek discuss seasonings .	He
[MASK] recalls a great Armenian musician and teacher ( his own teacher ) named Dirian Alexanian , editor of Bach 's Suites for Cello Unaccompanied and the most intolerant perfectionist	Schneider
[MASK] said to Pablo Casals after a performance of some of the suites , You made three bad mistakes .	Alexanian
[MASK] did not answer .	Casals
[MASK] knew Alexanian was right . "	He
Pale , with black hair in abundance , [MASK] is one of those short men who have learned to hold their ground against big ones .	Tatu
[MASK] sits with the ease that disguises this sort of tension .	He
His [MASK] is not friendly to Israel .	paper
Two or three times [MASK] consider whether to mention to him a letter I sent Le Monde during the 1973 war about the position being taken by France .	I
[MASK] want to ask him why it was n't printed .	I
But [MASK] succeed in suppressing this a triumph over myself .	I
Besides , [MASK] does not have the look of a man whose life is easy and I do n't see why I should spoil his Jerusalem dinner for him in his diary it would probably be entered as " An enchanted evening in Le Proche Orient with an Armenian archbishop . "	Tatu
[MASK] decide to let him enjoy his dinner .	I
Seeking common ground with my wife ( a laudable desire ) , [MASK] tells her that he too is Rumanian by origin .	he
[MASK] can safely say this , for his family came to France in the seventeenth century .	He
But [MASK] can see that the Archbishop gives him bad marks for lighting up after the main course .	I
[MASK] of real culture do not smoke at dinner tables .	People
[MASK] never know whom you have asked to your palace .	You
[MASK] , no mean judge of such matters , thought there was much to be said for the murderer 's point of view .	Dostoevski
[MASK] extends the position .	Navrozov
Liberal [MASK] is as brief as a bubble .	democracy
Now-and-then [MASK] treats us to an interval of freedom and civilization and we make much of it .	history
[MASK] forget , he seems to think , that as a species we are generally close to the " state of nature , " as Thomas Hobbes described it a nasty , brutish , pitiless condition in which men are too fearful of death to give much thought to freedom .	We
And [MASK] is what America , bubbling with political illusions , is up against .	this
So , at least , [MASK] thinks .	Navrozov
Perhaps [MASK] Solzhenitsyn agrees with him in part .	Alexander
My own [MASK] , Nota Gordon , two years out of the Soviet Union , says to me , " You are no match for them .	cousin
[MASK] do not understand with whom you are dealing . "	You

[MASK] are first cousins but he is Russian , I am an American , and in his Russian eyes an American is amiable , good-natured , attractive perhaps , but undeveloped , helpless : all that Dostoevski was to his fellow convict the murderer .	We
Nevertheless , [MASK] see that in a book called Things to Come two Americans who think themselves anything but undeveloped and helpless , Herman Kahn and B Bruce-Briggs , are not impressed by Russian achievements .	I
" In the foreign policy field the [MASK] have had an almost uninterrupted series of defeats and disappointments .	Soviets

For fifteen years the Soviet [MASK] has been supporting the Arabs against Israel in the Middle East and all they have to show for it is the humiliation of their proteges and the capture and destruction of their equipment by Israel .	Union

What the literary [MASK] faces in these political times .	imagination
[MASK] of the finest Israeli writers , A B Yehoshua , speaks about this in an excellent book of interviews , Unease in zion , edited by Ehud ben Ezer .	One
Nor can [MASK] attain the true solitude that is a condition and prerequisite of creation , the source and its strength .	you
During the Six Day War , [MASK] says that he felt himself linked to a great event , that he was within a historic wave and at one with its flow .	Yehoshua
[MASK] was a pleasant and elevating feeling .	This
But today , unable to see the end of war , [MASK] has lost the sensation of being borne upon any such wave .	he
" You do not achieve peace from history , " [MASK] says .	he
The [MASK] of being swept along and of uncertainty as regards the future prevents you from seeing things in any perspective whatsoever .	feeling
[MASK] live the moment , without any perspective , but you can not break free of the moment , forget the moment .	You
[MASK] can not cut yourself off and not read newspapers or stop hearing the news over the radio for weeks on end , as you could six or seven years ago . "	You
[MASK] is slightly different with us .	It
Our [MASK] make crisis chatter out of news and fill our minds with anxious phantoms of the real thing a summit in Helsinki , a treaty in Egypt , a constitutional crisis in India , a vote in the UN , the financial collapse of New York .	media
[MASK] ca n't avoid being politicized ( to use a word as murky as the condition it describes ) because it is necessary after all to know what is going on .	We
A cafeteria [MASK] in New York actually refers to a meeting in Canada between Churchill and Roosevelt , and a tussle with a drunk in the hallway of a rooming house corresponds to D-Day .	lunch
[MASK] am sorry to own I began to worry them .	I
[MASK] was already a fresh departure for me .	This
[MASK] always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go .	I
[MASK] would n't have believed it of myself ; but , then – you see – I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook .	I
So [MASK] worried them .	I
The [MASK] said ' My dear fellow ' and did nothing .	men
Then – would you believe it ? – [MASK] tried the women .	I
[MASK] , Charlie Marlow , set the women to work – to get a job . Heavens !	I
Well , you see , the [MASK] drove me .	notion
[MASK] had an aunt , a dear enthusiastic soul . She wrote : ' It will be delightful . I am ready to do anything , anything for you .	I
[MASK] is a glorious idea . I know the wife of a very high personage in the Administration , and also a man who has lots of influence with , &c. , &c .	It
[MASK] got my appointment – of course ; and I got it very quick .	I
[MASK] was my chance , and it made me the more anxious to go .	This
[MASK] – that was the fellow 's name , a Dane – thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain , so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick .	Fresleven
No doubt [MASK] was ; but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause , you know , and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way .	he
Therefore [MASK] whacked the old nigger mercilessly , while a big crowd of his people watched him , thunderstruck , till some man , – I was told the chief 's son , – in desperation at hearing the old chap yell , made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man – and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades .	he
Then the whole [MASK] cleared into the forest , expecting all kinds of calamities to happen , while , on the other hand , the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic , in charge of the engineer , I believe .	population
Afterwards [MASK] seemed to trouble much about Fresleven 's remains , till I got out and stepped into his shoes .	nobody
[MASK] could n't let it rest , though ; but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor , the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones .	I
[MASK] were all there .	They
A [MASK] had come to it , sure enough . The people had vanished .	calamity
Mad [MASK] had scattered them , men , women , and children , through the bush , and they had never returned .	terror
What became of the hens [MASK] do n't know either .	I
[MASK] should think the cause of progress got them , anyhow .	I
However , through this glorious affair [MASK] got my appointment , before I had fairly begun to hope for it .	I
[MASK] flew around like mad to get ready , and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers , and sign the contract .	I
In a very few hours [MASK] arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulcher .	I
[MASK] had no difficulty in finding the Company 's offices .	I
[MASK] was the biggest thing in the town , and everybody I met was full of it .	It
[MASK] were going to run an over-sea empire , and make no end of coin by trade .	They
[MASK] slipped through one of these cracks , went up a swept and ungarnished staircase , as arid as a desert , and opened the first door I came to .	I
Two [MASK] , one fat and the other slim , sat on straw-bottomed chairs , knitting black wool .	women
The slim [MASK] got up and walked straight at me – still knitting with downcast eyes – and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way , as you would for a somnambulist , stood still , and looked up . Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover , and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room .	one
[MASK] gave my name , and looked about .	I
However , [MASK] was n't going into any of these .	I
[MASK] was going into the yellow . Dead in the center .	I
And the [MASK] was there – fascinating – deadly – like a snake . Ough !	river
A [MASK] opened , a white-haired secretarial head , but wearing a compassionate expression , appeared , and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary .	door
Its [MASK] was dim , and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the middle .	light
[MASK] was five feet six , I should judge , and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions .	He
[MASK] shook hands , I fancy , murmured vaguely , was satisfied with my French .	He
In about forty-five seconds [MASK] found myself again in the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary , who , full of desolation and sympathy , made me sign some document .	I
[MASK] believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets .	I
Well , [MASK] am not going to .	I
[MASK] began to feel slightly uneasy .	I
[MASK] know I am not used to such ceremonies , and there was something ominous in the atmosphere .	You
In the outer room the two [MASK] knitted black wool feverishly .	women
A [MASK] had come in .	caravan
A violent [MASK] of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks .	babble
All the [MASK] were speaking together , and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard ' giving it up ' tearfully for the twentieth time that day ...	carriers
[MASK] rose slowly .	He
' What a frightful row , ' [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] crossed the room gently to look at the sick man , and returning , said to me , ' He does not hear . '	He
' What ! Dead ? ' [MASK] asked , startled .	I
Then , alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station-yard , ' When one has got to make correct entries , [MASK] comes to hate those savages – hate them to the death . '	one
[MASK] remained thoughtful for a moment .	He
[MASK] do n't like to write to him – with those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter – at that Central Station .	I
[MASK] stared at me for a moment with his mild , bulging eyes .	He
' Oh , [MASK] will go far , very far , ' he began again .	he
' [MASK] will be a somebody in the Administration before long .	He
[MASK] , above – the Council in Europe , you know – mean him to be .	They
[MASK] turned to his work .	He
The [MASK] outside had ceased , and presently in going out I stopped at the door .	noise
In the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound [MASK] was lying flushed and insensible ; the other , bent over his books , was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions ; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still tree-tops of the grove of death .	agent
Next day [MASK] left that station at last , with a caravan of sixty men , for a two-hundred-mile tramp .	I
The [MASK] had cleared out a long time ago .	population
Well , if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between Deal and Gravesend , catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them , [MASK] fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon .	I
Still [MASK] passed through several abandoned villages .	I
[MASK] had a white companion too , not a bad chap , but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides , miles away from the least bit of shade and water .	I
[MASK] could n't help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all .	I
What do you think ? [MASK] said , scornfully .	he
Then [MASK] got fever , and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole .	he
As he weighed sixteen stone [MASK] had no end of rows with the carriers .	I
[MASK] jibbed , ran away , sneaked off with their loads in the night – quite a mutiny .	They
So , one evening , [MASK] made a speech in English with gestures , not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me , and the next morning I started the hammock off in front all right .	I
An hour afterwards [MASK] came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush – man , hammock , groans , blankets , horrors .	I
The heavy [MASK] had skinned his poor nose .	pole
[MASK] was very anxious for me to kill somebody , but there was n't the shadow of a carrier near .	He
[MASK] remembered the old doctor , – ' It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals , on the spot .	I
[MASK] felt I was becoming scientifically interesting .	I
However , all [MASK] is to no purpose .	that
On the fifteenth day [MASK] came in sight of the big river again , and hobbled into the Central Station .	I
[MASK] was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest , with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side , and on the three others inclosed by a crazy fence of rushes . A neglected gap was all the gate it had ,	It
and the first [MASK] at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show .	glance
White [MASK] with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings , strolling up to take a look at me , and then retired out of sight somewhere .	men
[MASK] of them , a stout , excitable chap with black mustaches , informed me with great volubility and many digressions , as soon as I told him who I was , that my steamer was at the bottom of the river .	One
[MASK] was thunderstruck .	I
Oh , [MASK] was all right .	it
The [MASK] himself was there .	manager
[MASK] quite correct .	All
' [MASK] had behaved splendidly ! splendidly !	Everybody
– ' [MASK] must , ' he said in agitation , ' go and see the general manager at once .	you
Affected [MASK] have also criticized the fact that the manufacturer 's public declarations are also included in the defect definition .	parties
Ultimately [MASK] would be a disadvantage for the consumer .	that
[MASK] is the question of second-hand goods .	One
[MASK] believe that with this hierarchy we have solved many of the problems for small and medium enterprises .	I
At the same time [MASK] could result in job losses in the labour intensive repair services sector .	it
[MASK] is not to blame .	He
But on the other hand a good [MASK] will benefit him , both with respect to the product and to his service .	reputation
The [MASK] will need right of recourse which he can use to recover his costs from the manufacturer .	shopkeeper
Madam President , [MASK] do not have a script , just two observations .	I
[MASK] is an utterly ridiculous assumption .	That
But a [MASK] of protection is not the same as absolute cover against a host of things at the expense of something similar .	degree
[MASK] , for instance , is ' appropriate after-sales service ' ?	What
The [MASK] applies to a whole series of other examples we can give .	same
[MASK] is a sine-qua-non , and it would seem unnecessary to keep stressing it .	This
[MASK] believe that this would be a lot easier if consumers were involved .	I
[MASK] have to sustain the European Union as a major food producer and a major exporter .	We
And [MASK] would not want the opposite view to arise through any misunderstanding in the present report .	I
So [MASK] need to know the results of this debate and put them into effect .	we
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , [MASK] would like to read her speech to you .	I
Public [MASK] still has no faith in the Commission 's ability to exercise control .	opinion
Would [MASK] not be better than total harmonization , which is fundamentally a commercial rule aimed at promoting commercial interests , not food quality ?	that
The framework [MASK] is part of this process .	directive
[MASK] have just another brief comment on the foreign trade aspect .	I
If we are a member of an international rights community , then [MASK] must stay with it .	we
[MASK] is complicated because it deals with all nine separately and it is necessary to submit amendments in nine sets .	It
Upon which safeguards are [MASK] insisting ?	we
[MASK] is the problem : you can not comment on things that you have not read .	That
Our [MASK] has shown that these agencies do not need more controls .	research
To a certain extent , [MASK] reminds me of my previous activity in the Committee on Budgets and in the Committee on Budgetary Control .	this
[MASK] regret this and reaffirm our commitment to inform Parliament of all important agency decisions that have a financial impact .	We
[MASK] take note of that , Mr von Habsburg , and I should be grateful if you could provide us with this letter .	We
[MASK] have it here with me , Madam President .	I
If that facility is available to Vice-President – and good luck to him – is [MASK] available to other Members ?	it
Ladies and gentlemen , [MASK] are persistently confusing the Minutes with the Report of Proceedings .	you
[MASK] have therefore voted against the report .	I
Does the [MASK] have any sort of long-term policy in mind here ?	Commission
The taxpayer who has to pay for it , the smaller undertakings and species-friendly stock rearing [MASK] fall by the wayside .	all
Nor have [MASK] expanded my production .	I
What representation did the [MASK] receive from the United Kingdom Government about this dire emergency ?	Commissioner
The whole [MASK] is in crisis .	industry
In a case like this , those [MASK] that are still recommending increased production are being irresponsible .	governments
[MASK] should be the same throughout the EU to ensure no Member State gets an unfair advantage .	Measures
Through you [MASK] urge the Commission and the Council to reach decisions and take urgent action following the meeting on 14 October .	I
Europe 's [MASK] need help now .	farmers
[MASK] just goes to show the possibilities in our country !	That
But [MASK] do not take the view that including a corresponding reference to this in a recital can produce that result .	we
For generic [MASK] at the end of a patent or other protection period are of course useful .	drugs
The authentic [MASK] is ' under certain conditions ' .	text
[MASK] needs to be made very clear .	That
At some stage in their development all [MASK] experience problems arising from their weak capital resources .	SMEs
[MASK] and mentorship should go hand in hand .	Finance
This [MASK] reflects our group 's main concerns about the future of the ACP-EU link .	document
[MASK] vital to the health of Europeans certainly ought to be prioritised for intensified action and initiative by the European Union .	Areas
[MASK] has demonstrated its great interest in this area on a number of occasions .	Parliament
However , [MASK] can not support the reference to abortion .	I
But the harmful psychological [MASK] that abortions have on women are deliberately and constantly concealed .	effects
[MASK] to free abortions equates with women having the right to manage their lives and make decisions about their own bodies .	Entitlement
[MASK] am thinking here , amongst other things , of issues such as the law on abortion .	I
This [MASK] requires a comprehensive approach to policy making and the mobilisation of all policy actors .	objective
[MASK] would very much like to know on what kind of scientific evidence the Greens are basing all these amendments .	I
[MASK] have evidence , Mr President , but we apparently do not have proof .	We
[MASK] is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life .	This
Mr Tamino 's [MASK] are therefore greatly disproportionate .	proposals
The Commission 's [MASK] of what would be health-endangering values reflect the outcome of the research carried out .	estimates
Electromagnetic [MASK] and their effect on people are subjects that have come up for debate with increasing frequency in recent years .	fields
In point of fact , [MASK] still do not have any precise answers to the questions which they raise .	we
[MASK] should be establishing limit values on a Europe-wide basis , but they should be reasonable as well .	We
[MASK] are concentrated rays , but they do not penetrate down to where we usually are .	These
If necessary , the [MASK] will act at once .	Commission
[MASK] must work to end that in a sensible way .	We
The current [MASK] is ripe for review and the financial resources are regrettably very limited .	policy
The Needle [MASK] on the European Union 's new public health policy seems to ignore this fact completely .	report
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr [MASK] has gone to great trouble with the hearing in committee .	Needle
[MASK] also believe that the regional authorities are not all in a position to establish contacts with the Commission .	I
The [MASK] mentions best practice and standards in health care .	report
[MASK] is in fact the point of departure we have chosen here and I am very glad all this has been properly understood .	That
Unfortunately , at its last vote on the subject [MASK] approved these subsidies by a majority .	Parliament
But [MASK] will not stand by while the world 's trade rules are flouted .	Europe
The [MASK] is becoming increasingly bitter and is beginning to look like a trade war .	dispute
The European [MASK] put a new and revised banana regime in place on 1 January 1999 .	Union
For that and many other reasons [MASK] support the motion for a resolution .	we
The [MASK] States has shown that it holds negotiations in contempt .	United
If we do not achieve our objective of resolving this dispute , then [MASK] fear the WTO will slip on a banana skin .	I
[MASK] made a resigned grimace assuming understanding ... My wife and I decided we could n't stick it any longer .	He
So [MASK] try it out here .	we
[MASK] do n't know ; we 'll see .	I
[MASK] read you were coming back , there was an article in the paper , my wife Margot sent it to me in Switzerland , so I thought it was you .	I
[MASK] were just in front of me when we got out in Rome .	You
Yes , [MASK] suppose I wo n't know my way around when I get into town .	I
Oh , [MASK] 's still not New York or London , do n't worry .	it
The [MASK] spoke with an accent , and a certain European kind of resignation .	man
[MASK] laughed .	They
Well , in that case , [MASK] 'll probably bump into each other in Great Lakes Road .	we
[MASK] said I should have to learn my way round all over again .	I
The [MASK] looked about quickly and lowered his voice .	man
This [MASK] can do with a few more white people like you , take it from me .	country
Sometimes [MASK] even think I 'm down South again , that 's a fact .	I
[MASK] 've said it to my wife .	I
A young black [MASK] with sunglasses and a thick , springy mat of hair shaped to a crew-cut by topiary rather than barbering had cut through the crowd with the encircling movement of authority .	man
The other [MASK] , bobbing in the wash of this activity yet smiling at it in hostly assumption of his own established residence in the country , was talking across the black man and the exchange of pleasantries , tickets , thanks :	man
[MASK] thanked him , listening to the two men at once and hearing neither , and followed the firm rump in white shorts past barriers and through the reception hall .	He
[MASK] 's all right , officer , this is Colonel Bray .	That
[MASK] 'm looking after Colonel Bray , no need to bother him .	I
A youthful black [MASK] at passport control said uncertainly , Just a minute .	official
[MASK] do n't know about this ... but the pale Cockney who was teaching him to take over his job said , That 's okay , chum , it 's our ole friend Mr. Kabata .	I
The [MASK] was not waiting at the flag-draped and bunting-swathed entrance , where a picture of a huge Roman emperor Mweta , in a toga , smiled as he did in the old photograph of the Gala village football team .	luggage
Mr. [MASK] said , What 's the matter with these people . Excuse me , I 'll get a boy , and returned with the cases on the head of one of the stringy , splay-footed peasants who had always constituted the portering personnel .	Kabata
The [MASK] addressed both men as Mukwayi , the respectful term became servile during the long time when it was used indiscriminately for any white man .	porter
Beside him , Kabata 's strong [MASK] filled the seat .	thighs
[MASK] 's not too comfortable for a man your height , Colonel .	It
The [MASK] will be expecting me to have come for you with the Mercedes , but , honestly , if I 'd have waited to get it I would have turned up I do n't know when .	President
[MASK] know how it is just at the moment .	You
Mrs. [MASK] Gandhi arrives this afternoon and yesterday it was United Nations and Sekou Toure .	Indira
[MASK] said , All very festive , but it was distraction ; he had the feeling of listening inwardly , watching for something else .	He
The young [MASK] said , You are from Gala district .	man
[MASK] was .	I
But my [MASK] is a Gala .	mother
[MASK] have visited that place .	I
Perhaps [MASK] was still there then ?	I
[MASK] think they 'll be very pleased to see you back there .	I
[MASK] laughed .	He
[MASK] wonder if I 'll get that far .	I
Oh , you must make trip the young [MASK] said proudly .	man
[MASK] do it to Umsalongwe in ten hours .	I
[MASK] 'll see .	You
[MASK] could make it to Matoko in , say , six or seven .	You
My [MASK] is a little tiny thing , a second-hand crock .	car
Near the bridge the [MASK] were going for water with paraffin tins on their heads .	women
Advertisement [MASK] had gone up , there was a cement works , smart factories put together out of jutting glassy sections and , in between , the patches scratched in the bush where women and children were hoeing crooked rows of beans and maize .	hoardings
The [MASK] ( an excuse to dawdle , of course ) stopped and waved .	children
[MASK] found himself waving back urgently , bending his head under the low roof of the car , smiling and craning to hold their faces when they were already out of sight .	He
The [MASK] was approaching , was carrying him through the market quarter of the town .	car
Under the mango trees , barbers ' [MASK] set up a flash in the shade , and live chickens lay in heaps with their legs tied .	mirrors
[MASK] was the mango season , and there were the saffron-yellow sabres of the pips , sucked hairy , everywhere where people passed .	It
The [MASK] was on the roof of the round , thatched guest room in the garden of his old friend Roland Dando – a Welshman – newly appointed as Attorney-General .	bird
[MASK] gave him the African cook 's special lunch that he remembered so well : slightly burned meat soup with lots of barley , overdone steak with fried onions , a pudding frothy on top and gelatinous underneath , tasting of eggs and granadilla juice .	They
[MASK] rang up to see if he had arrived , and explained again – he had done so in advance by letter – that he had an official lunch to attend .	Roly
[MASK] went into the room kept darkened by drawn curtains and slept .	He
The [MASK] of thatch that rested on it was smooth and straight , grey where it was old , blond where it had been replaced , and , like a tidy head , here and there showed a single stray strand out of place .	underside
The [MASK] was probably balancing on the little porcelain conductor through which the electricity wire led to the light dangling above him .	bird
The [MASK] had come round and the curtains glowed like the sky above a fire .	sun
[MASK] felt he must be somewhere about ; it was difficult to imagine this time without him .	Bray
[MASK] was his as much as Mweta 's .	It
But [MASK] one seemed to have seen him , or to know whether he was , or had been , in the capital .	no
[MASK] Clough , the Governor , lifting his bristly eyebrows in exaggerated greeting at Mweta 's banquet , the way he used to do on the tennis court in Dar-es-Salaam .	William
James , [MASK] must come and say hello to Dorothy before we leave .	you
[MASK] dare n't say dine – we 're homeless , you know ...	I
Uncle Willie 's Independence [MASK] , Vivien said . Produces a hearty , man-of-the-world laugh from Africans .	Joke
Still , the [MASK] pursued Bray through Vivien .	Cloughs
Aunt [MASK] says her secretary 's been trying to get hold of you .	Dorothy
[MASK] want you for drinks on Monday .	They
[MASK] 'd go if I were you , or she 'll tell everyone in London you were buttering up to the Africans and did n't want to see them .	I
[MASK] laughed .	He
No , [MASK] 's true	it
[MASK] says that about me , to my mother .	She
And [MASK] knows quite well that we 'd never see each other in London either .	she
The [MASK] had moved into the British Consulate for the last week or two before their departure , a large , glassy , contemporary house placed to show off the umbrella thorn-trees of the site , just as in an architect 's scale model .	Cloughs
[MASK] saw the consul 's wife , whom he had met briefly , disappearing upstairs with her head bent consolingly to a Siamese .	he
[MASK] 's a good chap , if they 'll let him alone , he 's learnt a lot , and one 's done what one could ...	He
if [MASK] keeps his head , and that one ca n't be sure of , not even with him , mmh ? not even with him .	he
An elderly [MASK] came in with a silver tray of glasses and bottles , and Clough interrupted himself to say with the sweet forbearance of one who does not spare himself , encouraging where others would give way to exasperation , It would be so nice if we could have a few slices of lemon ... and more ice ?	servant
[MASK] knows his own mind but he 's not an intransigent fellow at all ...	He
well , of course , [MASK] know .	you
Some time ago ... a word in your ear , [MASK] said , you 'd be unwise to lose Brigadier Radcliffe .	I
Well , [MASK] 've been clamouring away , of course , but he 's refused to touch the army .	they
Oh , [MASK] think I can say we 've come out of it quite good friends .	I
[MASK] was a modest disclaimer , with the effect of assuming in common the ease with Africans that he believed Bray to have .	It
[MASK] looked pleasantly into the martini jug and put it down again patiently .	He
The elderly [MASK] who brought ice and lemon had the nicks at the outer corner of the eyes that Northern Gala people wore .	servant
[MASK] 's perfect .	That
[MASK] greeted the servant in Gala with the respectful form of address for elders and the man dumped the impersonality of a servant as if it had been the tray in his hands and grinned warmly , showing some pigmentation abnormality in a pink inner lip spotted like a Dalmatian .	Bray
The [MASK] looked on , smiling .	ex-Governor
The [MASK] bowed confusedly at him , walking backwards , in the tribal way before rank , and then recovering himself and leaving the room with an anonymous lope .	servant
[MASK] 'll pour Dorothy 's martini as well , maybe that 'll bring her .	I
anyway , [MASK] shall have three months in London now , with perhaps a week or two in Ireland .	we
What 've [MASK] been doing all these years in your ivory tower in Wiltshire ?	you
Were [MASK] a golfer , I ca n't quite remember ... ?	you
[MASK] Clough came in and Clough cried out , Does it fit ?	Dorothy
My dear James ... [MASK] must be a hundred years ...	it
[MASK] 've had a crate made to transport Fritzi , and she 's been trying it on him .	We
My niece [MASK] found a carpenter .	Vivien
[MASK] has the most extraordinary contacts , that girl .	She
[MASK] 's very useful !	It
[MASK] Clough took a pecking sip at his martini . He said with gallant good humour , Reposting was child 's play compared with this .	William
[MASK] has had to learn how to camp out ...	One
[MASK] 'm sure it 's terribly good , keeps the mind flexible .	I
[MASK] thinks your angle lamp 's been left at Government House , did he tell you ?	Denis
[MASK] Clough sat forward in her chair , as if she had alighted only for a moment .	Dorothy
wha' d' [MASK] say , James ...	you
[MASK] Dando asked with grudging interest about the visit .	Roly
He 's never been sent anywhere where there was anything left to do , [MASK] said .	he
[MASK] only goes in for the last year , after self-government 's been granted and the date for independence 's been given .	Clough
The impression was that [MASK] and his wife were slipping away quietly after the field of battle .	he
At the Pettigrews ' house that night , Dando 's [MASK] came from the group round someone basting a sheep on the home-made spit : ... damn all except go fishing with his secretary acting ghillie ...	voice
[MASK] Edwards had just told Neil Bayley that Felix Pasilis , the Pettigrews ' Greek friend , was furious with her because she 'd forgotten some essential herb that he wanted for his sheep ...	Rebecca
If I were Felix I 'd make you go back home and get it , my girl , [MASK] said , and the look of inattentive exhaustion on her rather heavy young face moved Bray in fellow-feeling to distract attention from her , saying , My God , I 'm afraid I behaved like a child at Cloughs ' !	Neil
[MASK] showed off by making a point of speaking to the servant in Gala .	I
[MASK] and Rebecca Edwards laughed .	Neil
[MASK] was quite a nice young man in Dar-es-Salaam .	He
[MASK] took Swahili lessons conscientiously and he certainly spoke it better than I did .	He
To his horror , the [MASK] burst into tears – very noisy tears .	elf
[MASK] thought he heard the voices downstairs falter .	Harry
[MASK] , trying to say Shh ! and look comforting at the same time , ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing , looking like a large and very ugly doll .	Harry
At last [MASK] managed to control himself , and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration .	he
[MASK] shook his head .	Dobby
[MASK] had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage .	Hedwig
[MASK] shuddered .	Dobby
Oh no , sir , no [MASK] will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir .	Dobby
[MASK] will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this .	Dobby
[MASK] is always having to punish himself for something , sir .	Dobby
[MASK] lets Dobby get on with it , sir .	They
But why do n't [MASK] leave ?	you
And the [MASK] will never set Dobby free .	family
[MASK] stared .	Harry
[MASK] makes the Dursleys sound almost human .	This
Ca n't [MASK] help you ?	anyone
Almost at once , [MASK] wished he had n't spoken .	Harry
[MASK] dissolved again into wails of gratitude .	Dobby
[MASK] has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew	Dobby
But [MASK] stopped quickly , because thinking about Hermione was painful .	he
[MASK] stopped again .	He
[MASK] leaned towards Harry , his eyes wide as headlamps .	Dobby
[MASK] heard tell , he said hoarsely , that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago . that Harry Potter escaped yet again .	Dobby
[MASK] nodded and Dobby 's eyes suddenly shone with tears .	Harry
[MASK] has braved so many dangers already !	He
But [MASK] has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later .	Dobby
But [MASK] 've got to go back – term starts on September the first .	I
[MASK] 's all that 's keeping me going .	It
[MASK] do n't know what it 's like here .	You
[MASK] do n't belong here .	I
[MASK] is too great , too good , to lose .	He
[MASK] Potter must not put himself in peril .	Harry
[MASK] made a funny choking noise and then banged his head madly against the wall .	Dobby
A sudden , unpleasant [MASK] struck him .	thought
Slowly , [MASK] shook his head .	Dobby
But Dobby 's [MASK] were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint .	eyes
[MASK] , however , was completely at sea .	Harry
[MASK] shook his head , his eyes wider than ever .	Dobby
[MASK] bowed his head .	Dobby
[MASK] Dumbledore is the greatest Headmaster Hogwarts has ever had .	Albus
[MASK] knows it , sir .	Dobby
[MASK] has heard Dumbledore 's powers rival those of He Who Must Not Be Named at the height of his strength .	Dobby
And before Harry could stop him , [MASK] bounded off the bed , seized Harry 's desk lamp , and started beating himself around the head with ear-splitting yelps .	Dobby
A sudden [MASK] fell downstairs .	silence
[MASK] stomped flat-footed from the room .	He
Shaking , [MASK] let Dobby out of the wardrobe .	Harry
[MASK] shuffled his feet .	Dobby
Stepping nimbly out of Harry 's reach , [MASK] pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing .	he
[MASK] could make out Hermione 's neat writing , Ron 's untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper , Hagrid .	Harry
The moment she saw Harry , [MASK] accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter .	Ginny
[MASK] seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room .	Ginny
[MASK] dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun .	She
Pretending he had n't noticed this , [MASK] sat down and took the toast Mrs Weasley offered him .	Harry
[MASK] 's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King 's Cross station on September the first .	Harry
SECOND-YEAR [MASK] WILL REQUIRE :	STUDENTS
[MASK] , who had finished his own list , peered over at Harry 's .	Fred
The new Defense Against the Dark Arts [MASK] must be a fan – bet it 's a witch .	teacher
At this point , [MASK] caught his mother 's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade .	Fred
Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? [MASK] asked Ginny .	Harry
[MASK] nodded , blushing to the roots of her flaming hair , and put her elbow in the butter dish .	She
Fortunately [MASK] one saw this except Harry , because just then Ron 's elder brother Percy walked in .	no
[MASK] sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately , pulling from underneath him a moulting , grey feather duster – at least , that was what Harry thought it was , until he saw that it was breathing .	He
[MASK] wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys .	I
Then [MASK] ripped open Hermione 's letter and read it out loud :	he
[MASK] hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you did n't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too .	I
[MASK] 've been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl , because I think another delivery might finish your one off .	I
[MASK] 'm very busy with schoolwork , of course –	I
– and [MASK] 're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books .	we
Why do n't [MASK] meet in Diagon Alley ?	we
[MASK] , Ron , Fred and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned .	Harry
[MASK] could n't use real Quidditch balls , which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village ; instead they threw apples for each other to catch .	They
[MASK] took turns to ride Harry 's Nimbus Two Thousand , which was easily the best broom ; Ron 's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies .	They
Five minutes later [MASK] were marching up the hill , broomsticks over their shoulders .	they
[MASK] had asked Percy if he wanted to join them , but he had said he was busy .	They
[MASK] had only seen Percy at meal-times so far ; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time .	Harry
If we 're not careful , [MASK] 'll have another Head Boy in the family .	we
[MASK] do n't think I could stand the shame .	I
[MASK] was the oldest Weasley brother .	Bill
[MASK] and the next brother , Charlie , had already left Hogwarts .	He
[MASK] had never met either of them , but knew that Charlie was in Romania , studying dragons , and Bill in Egypt , working for the wizard 's bank , Gringotts .	Harry
[MASK] said nothing .	Harry
[MASK] felt a bit awkward .	He
[MASK] had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys ; he did n't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold .	He
Mrs [MASK] woke them all early the following Wednesday .	Weasley
After a quick half-a-dozen bacon sandwiches each , [MASK] pulled on their coats and Mrs Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside .	they
[MASK] 'll have to buy some more today ah well , guests first !	We
And [MASK] offered him the flowerpot .	she
[MASK] stared at them all watching him .	Harry
[MASK] took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot , stepped up to the fire , and threw the powder into the flames .	He
With a roar , the [MASK] turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred , who stepped right into it , shouted , Diagon Alley ! and vanished .	fire
[MASK] lived in a big light spacious well-windowed generous house , designed by Lutyens .	We
My [MASK] had bought it for my mother in a grand gesture of love and pride .	father
The [MASK] shrubbed and green had a noose of trees all round it and in the centre of the rolled lawn was a Victorian sun-dial of granite and slate .	garden
[MASK] did not know what this meant and when I was able to translate it I did not understand it .	I
Later [MASK] came to mean a great deal to me but that is not yet .	it
His own [MASK] were Liverpool limeys ; had always worked the docks , the boats , in the Navy or as Merchant seamen .	family
The [MASK] had worked in the clutter of cargo offices up and down the quays .	women
His [MASK] , my grandmother , had been the Official Polisher of Brass Plaques and some said that when she had finished her Friday round the shine of it was so bright that it tipped the waves like a skimming stone and could still be seen in the harbour of New York .	mother
Then [MASK] see what we were for , the single stuttered words gain the momentum of narrative .	we
[MASK] is the story of a humble family who became a name .	This
My son [MASK] pulling history home .	David
When she was eleven , [MASK] died .	Papa
Within three months [MASK] in a little black suit , child in black warm coat , took ship to Hamburg and re-settled in Berlin .	Mother
My [MASK] was singing a hymn , essentially praising God but effectively preventing my father from hearing what was happening .	grandmother
[MASK] was a quick birth and when I was laid on my mother 's breast , my grandmother ate a sandwich and went to tell my father that he had the pleasure of a daughter .	It
It was what [MASK] had said a few months ago when he had been holding my wrist , too tightly , across a restaurant table .	Jove
[MASK] was still holding my hand and what I did was outside of anything I had imagined I would do .	She
[MASK] leaned across the narrow table and kissed her .	I
[MASK] never expected to go back down again .	I
When she ate her scones [MASK] left a snail-trail of soot along her upper lip .	she
Her [MASK] called her ' Blackmouth ' .	neighbour
My [MASK] called her neighbour ' Stinkpad ' but otherwise they were friendly , exchanging handkerchiefs and soap at Christmas .	grandmother
[MASK] bedshares with arrogance .	Cowardice
[MASK] was afraid and I wanted to bluff my way out .	I
The [MASK] was a smoke bomb to cause confusion and distract attention .	kiss
[MASK] thought she might slap me .	I
[MASK] thought she would rush away .	I
In fact [MASK] did nothing .	she
[MASK] started to re-eat my cold pasta .	I
[MASK] would have been glad to climb into the plate and cover myself in clam sauce .	I
[MASK] was at the age of making lists but the lists I made were correspondences , half true and altogether fanciful , of the earth the sea and the sky .	I
Perhaps [MASK] was trying to hold together my own world that was in so much danger of falling away .	I
Perhaps [MASK] wanted order where there was none .	I
As the QE2 floated so confidently on the waters [MASK] thought of the Titanic , ghostly and abandoned beneath , and somewhere above , in the secretive blackness , the Ship of Fools navigating the stars .	I
Was [MASK] the comet ?	it
Accordingly , my [MASK] put on his Jolly Jack Tars and my mother wrapped herself up in her mink coat .	father
In those days their [MASK] was a three-litre Rover , really , a leather three-piece suite and cocktail cabinet on wheels .	car
My [MASK] purred down to the docks looking like a criminal , while my mother fixed herself a strictly forbidden gin and tonic in the back .	father
When Stella kissed me [MASK] remember thinking , ' This is not allowed . '	I
[MASK] was glad of the fog and the dark because I knew that if anyone saw us , the totality of our lives ; history , complexity , nationality , intelligence , age , achievement , status , would be shrunk up to the assumptions of our kiss .	I
' David , ' [MASK] said .	she
[MASK] was wearing a black oilskin that had been her husband 's .	She
[MASK] hung on her from head to foot , so much so that she seemed less to be wearing a rainproof than to be in the grip of a monster from the Deep .	It
[MASK] and I would be approaching the place from opposite ends of town .	She
[MASK] imagined her , angry , confident , ready to match me and beat me at my own game .	I
[MASK] was the big fight and Jove the prize .	This
When I told him she had written to me [MASK] had decided to visit friends for the weekend .	he
At the same time [MASK] realised that I would like to do much more kissing if it were not so complicated .	I
My first serious [MASK] was for a married man .	emotion
My first [MASK] of authentic desire was with a married woman .	experience
[MASK] see , I did want to kiss her .	You
As he gossiped and lounged the [MASK] of the Remington stopped .	noise
His [MASK] came out from the low line of offices that huddled to the waterfront .	secretary
Would [MASK] step inside at once ?	he
My [MASK] loved the sea and should have been an active seaman but there were more opportunities indoors for a bright boy who had a way about him .	father
[MASK] compensated by wheedling his way onto the tugs , and because there was still an apprenticeship mentality about the Company , his oddity was tolerated .	He
What harm could [MASK] do and was n't all experience useful ?	it
Besides , [MASK] did it in his own time and it made him popular with the men .	he
Meanwhile , in a maze of soggy sheets and copies of Woman 's Weekly , my [MASK] speared my mother on his manhood .	father
The [MASK] poured through his fingers ; spices , wine , tea , green bananas , coconuts , American golf clubs , blankets made of wool with satin hemmed round the edges .	world
Today [MASK] were loading nylon stockings , Monroe look-alikes stamped all over the cardboard boxes .	they
' [MASK] came here to meet ... '	I
[MASK] had risen in the world and now he was going to prove it .	He
On board my [MASK] unpacked her carpet bag .	grandmother
[MASK] set out a pile of clean rags , the ones she used for polishing the brass plaques , a bottle of cooking brandy , a bottle of iodine , a primus stove , a cylinder of water , a kitchen knife , a packet of sandwiches , a little blanket from the dog 's box , her spectacles and the Bible , now open towards the end of the Psalms .	She
This done , [MASK] took off her oilskin and pegged it over the hatch .	she
[MASK] had her letter in my pocket .	I
' [MASK] will meet you on Wednesday the 12th at 6:30 p.m. in the bar at the Algonquin Hotel . '	I
[MASK] knew the gangmen and the loaders and the truck drivers and the harbour pilots , and as he leaned on his rail , watching , sometimes waving , other men joined him , lit a cigarette , told him the news and with a slap on the back , moved on .	He
The easy [MASK] of working men was comfortable to him .	fraternity
[MASK] one here asked him what school he had attended .	No
' Must [MASK] try and do eight things at once ? '	you
[MASK] used to imagine that there was an octopus , hooded , ancient , floating in the limp waters of my body , reaching out , dark and blind , using the tentacles to probe what stood outside it .	I
[MASK] fail , but I am capable of behaving like an eight-armed cephalopod while protesting the innocence of my two hands on the table .	Analogies
[MASK] poured her money into him as though he were a treasure chest .	She
[MASK] learned well , looked well , and if anyone questioned him about his Mersey terrace two up two down he simply knocked them out .	He
Throughout his life my [MASK] has dealt with difficult questions by knocking them out .	father
[MASK] never gave up singing and playing the piano and she never gave up her watercolours .	She
The rest of the mind [MASK] disposed of at marriage and did not think to ask my father what he had done with it .	she
Why had [MASK] chosen here ?	she
Here [MASK] was .	it
Did [MASK] say that ?	I
No [MASK] did .	she
[MASK] sometimes think my personality is a troopship 's atoll ; invade me .	I
And so the [MASK] of them climbed aboard the Godspeed and chugged into the dark .	three
When I was born the [MASK] were still alive .	waters
My [MASK] too , was still alive , strong and burly , as wide as he was tall , with an enormous chest that looked as though it could tow the cargo boats itself .	father
[MASK] cooked breakfast in the remains of the frying pan and ate our food standing up , looking out of the window over to the park .	We
