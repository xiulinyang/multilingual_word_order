Much later , when he was able to think about the things that happened to him , he would [MASK] that nothing was real except chance .	conclude
In the summer he [MASK] baseball on television ; in the winter he went to the opera .	watched
Nearly every day , rain or shine , hot or cold , he would [MASK] his apartment to walk through the city – never really going anywhere , but simply going wherever his legs happened to take him .	leave
As a young man , he had [MASK] several books of poetry , had written plays , critical essays , and had worked on a number of long translations .	published
But quite abruptly , he had [MASK] up all that .	given
A part of him had died , he [MASK] his friends , and he did not want it coming back to haunt him .	told
And who that person was he [MASK] no idea .	had
Nevertheless , as time wore on he [MASK] himself doing a good imitation of a man preparing to go out .	found
An hour later , as he climbed from the number 4 bus at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue , he still had not [MASK] the question .	answered
In his mind , he [MASK] a glimpse of the blue map on the wall and the sunlight pouring through the window , so like the sunlight that surrounded him now .	caught
As he opened the door that would lead him into the lobby , he [MASK] himself one last word of advice .	gave
For some reason , Quinn had not [MASK] this , and it threw him off track .	expected
Therefore , even in those first moments , he had [MASK] ground , was starting to fall behind himself .	lost
As he crossed the threshold and entered the apartment , he could [MASK] himself going blank , as if his brain had suddenly shut off .	feel
Yes . No . [MASK] you .	Thank
Or else I will not [MASK] you .	tell
At the corner of 72nd Street and Madison Avenue , he [MASK] down a cab .	waved
As the car rattled through the park toward the West Side , Quinn [MASK] out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light .	looked
What Stillman did on these walks [MASK] something of a mystery to Quinn .	remained
No matter how haphazard his journeys seemed to be – and each day his itinerary was different – Stillman never [MASK] these borders .	crossed
Occasionally , after poring over an object in this way , Stillman would [MASK] it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it .	toss
Then , reaching into one of his coat pockets , he would [MASK] a red notebook – similar to Quinn 's but smaller – and write in it with great concentration for a minute or two .	remove
Having completed this operation , he would [MASK] the notebook to his pocket , pick up his bag , and continue on his way .	return

The fact that Stillman took this scavenging seriously [MASK] Quinn , but he could do no more than observe , write down what he saw in the red notebook , hover stupidly on the surface of things .	intrigued
At the same time , it [MASK] him to know that Stillman also had a red notebook , as if this formed a secret link between them .	pleased
Once a car nearly [MASK] him over as he was crossing the street .	ran
On most days he [MASK] at least several hours in Riverside Park , walking methodically along the macadam footpaths or else thrashing through the bushes with a stick .	spent

Once , on a particularly warm day , Quinn [MASK] him sprawled out on the grass asleep .	saw
When darkness came , Stillman would [MASK] dinner at the Apollo Coffee Shop on 97th Street and Broadway and then return to his hotel for the night .	eat
This view of the situation [MASK] Quinn , and he decided to believe in it , even though he had no grounds for belief .	comforted
If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then Quinn would [MASK] this knowledge as an article of faith , at least for the time being .	accept
His excursions through the city had [MASK] him to understand the connectedness of inner and outer .	taught
Using aimless motion as a technique of reversal , on his best days he could [MASK] the outside in and thus usurp the sovereignty of inwardness .	bring

At the very worst , they could [MASK] on new identities , live under different names .	take

In other words , to what extent would people [MASK] blasphemies if they gave them amusement ?	tolerate
For the proof is that we still [MASK] the book .	read
The man was obviously [MASK] himself , but the precise nature of that pleasure eluded Quinn .	enjoying
In his left hand he [MASK] a red object that Quinn could not identify .	held
It 's June second , he [MASK] himself .	told
For some reason , he [MASK] it unpleasant to look in the mirror and kept trying to avoid himself with his eyes .	found
In the top of the fourth St. Louis [MASK] five runs , and Quinn turned off the picture as well .	scored
When he tried to call again , he could no longer [MASK] a dial tone .	get

Rather than coming to the aid of the Confederacy , France [MASK] the Civil War to provide a pretext for efforts to reestablish its former eighteenth - century colonial holdings .	used
Still , the Confederacy [MASK] great confidence that it would find an ally in Great Britain despite the antislavery sentiment there .	had
The fact that the British proved willing to build and sell ironclad ships intended to smash through the Union naval blockade further [MASK] Southern hopes .	raised
The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation [MASK] any doubts the British had about the goals of the Union cause .	ended
Ultimately , Great Britain , like France , [MASK] the Confederacy ’s hope of an alliance , leaving the outnumbered and out - resourced states that had left the Union to fend for themselves .	disappointed
At the beginning of the war , in 1861 and 1862 , Union forces had [MASK] contrabands , or escaped enslaved people , for manual labor .	used
Although many Black soldiers saw combat duty , these factors [MASK] the types of tasks assigned to them .	affected

The purpose of this pilot study was to [MASK] the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .	assess
When regarding an artwork , a viewer [MASK] information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .	gathers
Importantly , studying eye movements [MASK] an insight that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .	offers
Previous eye tracking research has [MASK] the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .	highlighted
In this study we [MASK] eye - tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .	used
This pilot project primarily [MASK] how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye - tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour .	investigated
Tenured and tenure - track university faculty [MASK] a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers .	play
Most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , [MASK] a single all - encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web - based faculty directories for individual departments .	lack
One of the largest census efforts to date [MASK] , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] .	assembled
This data set has [MASK] considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] .	shed
In computer science , the Computing Research Association ( CRA ) [MASK] trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .	documents
Second , aggregate information [MASK] only a high - level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .	provides
By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone , this system will [MASK] new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings , without having to rely on surveys or professional societies .	facilitate
Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the system can [MASK] scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances .	elucidate
Throughout the second half of the 20th century , we have [MASK] the return of institutions to economic analysis .	witnessed
For its part , North [MASK] the institutions as the “ rules of the game ” : they determine the structure of the economy , establish incentives for economic behavior , and affect social interaction [ 12 ] .	defined
Thus , institutions also [MASK] the level of uncertainty to which individuals are subject , stimulating or discouraging transactions .	determine
Of course , the state [MASK] a lead role in promoting this type of institution .	takes
If there are disagreements about the policies to be implemented , then the group that wins the political game will [MASK] the final decision .	make
On the one hand , a society that adopts policies promoting inclusive political institutions will [MASK] pluralist and centralized institutions .	develop
In governments with extractive policies , the group in power usually [MASK] resources from the rest of the population for its own enrichment and well - being .	extracts
Another feature of this type of government is that powerful interest groups [MASK] increased pluralism because it typically results in the loss of their privileges .	oppose
Moreover , compliance mechanisms must [MASK] ex ante and ex post standards [ 12 ] .	reflect
In order to understand policymaking and its effects , one must [MASK] adequate knowledge of the focal country ’s institutional framework .	have
Achieving political order would [MASK] the government to limit its actions and guarantee the rights of citizens — neither of which has yet occurred in Argentina .	require
Given that need , we have [MASK] software , based on Natural Language Processing , that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish , and applied it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors , from the 15th to the 19th century .	developed
First , the literature [MASK] a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment , if split across two lines , and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify enjambment .	shows
Systematically collecting large amounts of enjambment examples [MASK] helpful evidence to assess scholars ’ current claims , and may stimulate novel analyses .	provides
Finally , our study [MASK] Navarro ’s ( 2016 ) automatic metrical analyses of Spanish Golden Age sonnets , by covering a wider period and focusing on enjambment .	complements
The project ’s website [MASK] details omitted here for space reasons , including samples for the corpus , results , and other details .	provides
Quilis ( 1964 ) [MASK] poetry reading experiments , proposing that the following strongly connected elements give rise to enjambment , should a poetic - form pause break them up :	performed
To differentiate these cases from enjambment proper , Spang [MASK] these cases " enlace " , translated here as " expansion " .	calls
if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility , they must [MASK] what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources ( on pain of infinite regress ) .	know
In fact , many , if not all , the markers of expertise identified by philosophers [MASK] widespread recognition .	enjoy
The fact that these criteria are widely known , however , [MASK] an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting .	offers
Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers , to mimic the markers of expertise is to [MASK] expertise [ 17 ] .	mimic
This fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , [MASK] ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources .	reduces
For instance , those with an interest in deceiving the general public may [MASK] up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise , taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in .	set
For example , a small number of doctors [MASK] up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds ) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care .	set
Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many people [MASK] the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] .	mistook
When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it [MASK] an epistemic pollutant .	introduces
A yet more egregious example of such pollution [MASK] collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer - reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] .	involved
Once again , this phenomenon [MASK] the effect of making peer - reviewed journals appear less legitimate .	has
Frontiers in Public Health controversially [MASK] articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] .	published
If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate , one can not reasonably [MASK] ordinary people to make such judgments .	expect
If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution , one can hardly [MASK] them .	blame
For example , universities [MASK] a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students .	have
Furthermore , before and after the implementation of the intervention , we [MASK] a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention , as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed .	performed
In addition , students participating in the interview [MASK] a preference for games that involve problem solving , recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities , and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention .	reported
A fundamental tenet of linguistic science is that the sound of a word [MASK] a purely arbitrary connection to the word 's meaning [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .	has
But it is not that a word can [MASK] just any vocal sound .	have
While the possibility space for sound systems of the world 's language is enormous , any given language [MASK] use of only a restricted portion of the possible sounds [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .	makes
But in this study we [MASK] a striking exception to this otherwise robust rule .	present
From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we [MASK] evidence suggesting that a word like ‘ Huh ? ’ – used as a ‘ repair initiator ’ when , for example , one has not clearly heard what someone just said [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] – is a universal word .	find
After speaker G makes a statement , speaker E [MASK] the interjection huh ? .	utters
Extracts 2 and 3 [MASK] structurally identical sequences in two other languages : Siwu , a Kwa language spoken in Ghana , and Lao , a Tai - Kadai language spoken in Laos .	show
Essentially , this method [MASK] us a natural control over conversational data , making possible systematic comparison across languages [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .	gives
The most reliable way to study a conversational interjection is by [MASK] cases of actual use .	examining
For optimal comparability , we [MASK] the exact same conversational environment across languages : that of other - initiated repair ( OIR ) , in which one participant produces a turn at talk , the other then signals some trouble with this turn , and finally the first produces a next turn which aims to solve the trouble , usually by means of repetition and / or modification .	studied
Such alternative ( and probably derived ) uses [MASK] insight in possible paths of semantic change , but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like .	provide
Future studies should also [MASK] a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult - like performance emerges .	include
Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have [MASK] evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .	found
Additional training with the methodology could [MASK] outcomes .	improve
Albeit limited , these results [MASK] valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga - speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .	provide
In response to the said problem , this project study [MASK] solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light - emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals .	gives
About 87 percent of 21.0 million households [MASK] electricity from March to August 2011 .	used
Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as shown in figure 1 , [MASK] nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption .	consume
The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb [MASK] the efficiency of energy usage .	improves
But each of them [MASK] their perks and perils [ 3 ] .	has
In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources , the proponents [MASK] this study .	conducted
Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials , the proponents [MASK] a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb .	conducted
In this article , we [MASK] the definition of specific mutation operators for testing Geographic Information Systems .	propose
In the state of the art , we have [MASK] mutation operators , both general purpose and specific to different technologies , languages and paradigms [ 2 – 9 ] .	found
In this article , we [MASK] mutation operators specific to the domain of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) applications .	propose
In addition , we [MASK] the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real - world GIS applications and we generate the mutants .	present
As a previous step to designing the mutation operators , we [MASK] the main technologies used specifically in the development of GIS , and we identified typical errors a programmer can introduce during the development .	analyzed
From these data , we [MASK] the mutation operator , in the form of on aspect , which will then be possible to interweave with the SUT which generates a mutant of the SUT .	generate
By creating a Geofence with an erroneous location from its central location , the device will [MASK] incorrect location notifications .	receive
As a result , the user will [MASK] in the application ’s map viewer the Geofences drawn in erroneous zones ( Figure 1 ) .	see
The objective of the land reparcelling is to [MASK] the lands of an owner to facilitate their exploitation .	reunify
In existing proposals , we can [MASK] both generic and specific mutation operators .	find
In addition , we have [MASK] the operators defined in two GIS applications .	tested
The Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , [MASK] a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin & Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) .	provides
In some fields , a flourishing metascience , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has [MASK] syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel & Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) .	included
The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis [MASK] several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken .	have
Indeed , some commentators have [MASK] replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , & Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) .	called
In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , one might [MASK] a substantial number of published replication studies by now .	expect
However , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication [MASK] L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez - Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , & Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) , and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .	plagues
To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research , the systematic review [MASK] a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self - labeled as replications .	provides
Thus , our overall aim is to [MASK] conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies , with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research .	provide
At the end of 1990 , two airborne microwave interferometers , the electronically scanned thinned array radiometer ( ESTAR ) and the scanning low - frequency microwave radiometer ( SLFMR ) , successfully [MASK] SSS maps in coastal areas in agreement with in - situ measurements with an accuracy of about 1 psu .	produced
Thus , remote sensing of SSS [MASK] a highly accurate retrieval model .	requires
For example , the TSM originally proposed to estimate brightness temperature at higher frequencies , [MASK] the sea surface wave spectrum by multiplying a factor of 2 .	uses
In addition , the widely used empirical models [MASK] the wind effect from SSS and SST effects , which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind - roughened sea surface .	decouple
The posterior displacement of the CoM [MASK] a more vertically oriented femur during standing ( femur in experimental animals was 40 % more vertical than control subjects ) , and increased femoral retraction and decreased knee flexion during walking .	produced
In fact , the control - weight subjects [MASK] a more horizontally oriented femur during walking with respect to the control group , similar to that observed in Carrano and Biewener 's experimental subjects [ 7 ] .	showed
Differences in limb orientation can [MASK] substantial differences in loading regimes on limb bones .	produce
The orientation of each limb element to the ground reaction force ( GRF ) [MASK] the relative contribution of axial and bending forces to external bone loading : a bone perpendicular to the GRF is expected experience greater bending forces than one parallel to the GRF .	indicates
To test if the postural differences observed in this study produced changes in limb morphology , we [MASK] the length and mid-shaft cross-sectional properties of the femur in all our individuals .	measured
If this were the case , it would [MASK] the idea that non-avian theropods have relatively thinner femora than extant birds because of postural differences [ 6 ] .	support
During avian evolution , the loss of the CFL and reorganization of the pelvic musculature [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] could have [MASK] birds unable to properly carry a postacetabular mass equivalent to that carried by non-avian theropods [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .	made
In addition , we [MASK] the total tail mass to 15 % body mass from the 20 % body mass used by Carrano and Biewener .	reduced
Interestingly , the femur kinematics during walking in our control - weight group [MASK] the results reported in the experimental subjects of Carrano and Biewener .	resembles
One caveat , however , is that our approach [MASK] tail reduction as the mechanism for CoM displacement despite it has been recently shown that the evolutionary change in CoM position was driven instead by forelimb enlargement [ 8 ] .	uses
Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) , it has [MASK] five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28 - city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan - based creations .	spawned

In this sense , fans of the series [MASK] an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored .	represent
The study of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system [MASK] valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies , by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information - user .	provides

Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson [MASK] Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ]	declared
Apparently , however , Galois did not [MASK] Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ]	ignore
Galois ' fatal duel [MASK] place on 30 May . [ 17 ]	took
What is known is that five days before his death , he [MASK] a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair . [ 7 ]	wrote
As to his opponent in the duel , Alexandre Dumas [MASK] Pescheux d'Herbinville , [ 13 ] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois ' first arrest . [ 20 ]	names
On the other hand , extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel [MASK] a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D.
